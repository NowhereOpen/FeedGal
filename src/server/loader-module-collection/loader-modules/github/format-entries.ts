       * Committer vs author. It seems like the author is some one who made the pull request and
       * the committer is someone who accepts it into the branch/repo. For example:
       * 
       *   - https://github.com/chulman444/gyst-tiddlywiki/commit/23797b05a1c7e5a05055e8b6750e06686a1d6aa1
       * 
       * And this happens for repos that I forked. Commits that were made by the actual author before I
       * forked it have `author: null`:
       * 
       *   - https://github.com/chulman444/gyst-tiddlywiki/commit/2a3f1b44030ed10a4cef4442cab5050a080fc2f0
