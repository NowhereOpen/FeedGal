Facebook can choose to implement the recommendations in the report or to dismiss them — which is what some advocates like Robinson fear. In a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/civil-rights-audit-report/\">blog post announcing the report’s release</a> on Wednesday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said that the company “won’t make every change they [auditors] call for,” but that it “will put more of their proposals into practice.”</p>\n<p id=\"9zOTu7\">Regardless of what the company ends up doing, the audit serves as a thorough examination of Facebook’s long-standing struggle to reconcile its stated values around free speech with the history of harm caused by unchecked vitriol and discrimination on its platform. With that overarching theme in mind, here are five key takeaways about Facebook and civil rights from the 89-page report.\t</p>\n<h3 id=\"XQuyX6\">1) Holding Trump to a different standard sets a troubling precedent</h3>\n<p id=\"tiSeuH\">Facebook has failed to penalize Trump for violating its community guidelines, the auditors say, which stands “to gut policies” that had represented progress for civil rights on the platform. The report specifically highlights a group of Trump’s posts that made <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/26/21271210/twitter-fact-check-trump-tweets-mail-voting-fraud-rigged-election-misleading-statements\">misleading claims about voting</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/1/21277108/facebook-employees-protest-mark-zuckerberg-trump-looting-shooting-george-floyd-fact-check\">president’s infamous “looting … shooting” post</a> about protesters. Echoing previous concerns from civil rights groups, the auditors say these posts clearly violate Facebook’s community guidelines and that not removing them establishes a concerning precedent for Trump and other politicians. </p>\n<p id=\"kCi3X1\">The voting-related posts by Trump referenced in the report include false claims about mail-in ballots in <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/more-false-mail-in-ballot-claims-from-trump/\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trumps-false-tweet-about-michigan-absentee-ballot-applications/\">Michigan, and Nevada</a>. Facebook ultimately decided that these posts did not violate its guidelines, arguing in the case of Michigan and Nevada that the language in the posts was merely “challenging the legality of officials.” The auditors explain that they “vehemently expressed” their view that the posts violated policy but were “not afforded an opportunity to speak directly to decision-makers” until after the final decision was made. </p>\n<p id=\"mltx5A\">Facebook’s decisions, they said, constitute a “tremendous setback for all of the policies that attempt to ban voter suppression on Facebook.”</p>\n<p id=\"qelkl8\">Trump’s “looting ... shooting” post represents a similar pattern of self-justified inaction. In that post, the president appeared to threaten violence against Black Lives Matter protesters, using language <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post\">that echoed Civil Rights-era white segregationists</a>. Though Facebook executives <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-with-trump-minneapolis-george-floyd-post-2020-6\">called the White House</a> requesting that Trump change or delete the post, the company ultimately did nothing about it. By contrast, Twitter chose to label an identical post by President Trump on its platform for violating its rules about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/29/21274359/trump-tweet-minneapolis-glorifying-violence\">glorifying violence</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"hzR8gK\">Facebook defended its decision by arguing that threats of state action are allowed on the platform. The auditors say that logic ignored “how such statements, especially when made by those in power and targeted toward an identifiable, minority community, condone vigilantism and legitimize violence against that community.“ They added, “Random shooting is not a legitimate state use of force.” Again, the auditors say they were not included in the decision-making process in time. Facebook’s decision about the “looting … shooting” post, which Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post\">later defended</a> on a call with employees, prompted criticism from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/1/21277108/facebook-employees-protest-mark-zuckerberg-trump-looting-shooting-george-floyd-fact-check\">company executives and a virtual employee walkout</a>. It was one of the incidents that inspired the Stop Hate for Profit boycott. </p>\n<p id=\"aE4pPZ\">In June, Facebook announced it will label posts that violate its community guidelines but are left up because they’re <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/\">deemed newsworthy</a> (and if their public interest value eclipses the harm they cause), but that doesn’t seem to happen very often. The audit revealed that over the last year, the company only applied the newsworthy exception to politicians 15 times, and only once in the United States, and it was not immediately clear what those instances were. </p>\n<p id=\"81mGre\">Meanwhile, the company still hasn’t taken any action against Trump’s past posts, and the auditors concluded that for many civil rights advocates, “the damage has already been done.” Even if Facebook has policies supporting civil rights, the auditors concluded, the refusal to enforce them against Trump has eroded trust in the company and leaves room for other politicians to follow in Trump’s footsteps. </p>\n<h3 id=\"yT2u2O\">2) Valuing free speech above all else creates problems</h3>\n<p id=\"nfx6Ym\">While Facebook’s leadership has repeatedly emphasized the company’s commitment to free expression, the auditors found that this comes at a cost. Facebook systematically chooses to prioritize the speech of politicians over clamping down on harmful and hateful rhetoric, which hurts its users overall. Several times in the report, the auditors cite Mark <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/georgetownuniv/videos/2193972280707148/\">Zuckerberg’s 2019 speech at Georgetown</a> as a “turning point,” where Facebook <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/10/17/20919505/mark-zuckerberg-georgetown-free-speech-facebook\">doubled down on its commitment to free expression</a> as “a governing principle of the platform.” </p>\n<p id=\"8eaRTV\">Facebook’s choice not to fact-check politicians — and to allow them to sometimes <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/\">break Facebook’s own rules against posting harmful content</a> because what politicians’ say is inherently newsworthy — represents another problem. Both steps have significantly hurt the company’s civil rights efforts, the auditors said. Allowing politicians to spread misinformation about voting, which Mark Zuckerberg in his Georgetown speech argued was a form of free expression, particularly undermines Facebook’s commitment to its own values. The auditors said they found Facebook’s prioritization of free speech over other values, like non-discrimination and equality, “deeply troubling.” </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"ZNSKX5\"><q>The auditors said they found Facebook’s prioritization of free speech over other values, like nondiscrimination and equality, “deeply troubling”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"AGvHd1\">By forming exemptions for politicians’ content, they argue, a “hierarchy of speech is created that privileges certain voices over less powerful voices.”  </p>\n<p id=\"VDwj36\">The report, however, acknowledges that Facebook is failing to address the tension between its civil rights promises and its monolithic commitment to free expression. Instead, the company should work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of free speech that acknowledges how typical users actually experience the platform. </p>\n<p id=\"UYk0C2\">“For a 21st century American corporation, and for Facebook, a social media company that has so much influence over our daily lives, the lack of clarity about the relationship between those two values is devastating,” lead auditor Laura W. Murphy wrote in the report’s introduction. “It will require hard balancing, but that kind of balancing of rights and interests has been part of the American dialogue since its founding and there is no reason that Facebook cannot harmonize those values, if it really wants to do so.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"TlmcAd\">3) Hate speech is still a problem for Facebook, and we don’t know how bad it really is</h3>\n<p id=\"J7sfAT\">Facebook has long struggled with hateful and violent speech on its platform, including from white nationalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/21/facebook-white-nationalists-ban-vdare-red-ice\">streaming talk shows on Facebook Watch</a> and members of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/8/21276911/boogaloo-explained-civil-war-protests\">“boogaloo movement”</a> that promote anti-government ideology and has instigated violence at recent racial justice protests.</p>\n<p id=\"3kLMro\">Facebook’s audit highlights that the company has a long way to go in combating hate speech, particularly around white nationalism. Despite improvements Facebook has made some progress: It says it’s gotten better at identifying hate speech, and it now has a team of 350 people who work exclusively on combating dangerous groups on Facebook. But the auditors say hateful content often stays on the platform for longer than it should or doesn’t get removed in the first place. This is an “especially acute” problem with content targeting African Americans, Jews, and Muslims, according to the audit. </p>\n<p id=\"s4Jfbz\">For example, the auditors asked Facebook to ban all content that promotes white nationalist or white separatist ideology, something Facebook has so far failed to do. The company has explicitly banned phrases like “white nationalism” or “white separatism,” but that simplistic approach still allows racist content to continue to spread on the platform, the auditors said. </p>\n<p id=\"WhqaZK\">The audit also criticized Facebook for not taking down hateful events fast enough. The report highlights how in 2019, it took Facebook over 24 hours to remove an event intended to <a href=\"https://www.houstonpress.com/news/texas-patriot-network-plans-to-protest-isna-11345149\">physically intimidate attendees</a> at the Islamic Society of North America’s annual meeting in Houston, Texas. Facebook has acknowledged its misstep with that incident, but auditors called for the company to fundamentally revise its review process to expedite the removal of such events. Properly moderating events, the report says, is essential “to ensure that people cannot use Facebook to organize calls to arms to harm or intimidate specific groups” during the current nationwide protests. </p>\n<p id=\"tlirJK\">One thing complicating Facebook’s hate speech problem is the fact that there’s not enough hard data to know how bad it is or how it impacts different groups. The report says “the absence of data for analysis and study seems to undercut efforts to document and define the problem, identify its source, and explore potential mitigation.” </p>\n<p id=\"s9ZyHX\">While the audit focused on issues of hate speech, it also touched on a related and even more complex issue that has dogged Facebook for years: whether or not its platform politically polarizes its users and how this might be connected to the hate speech that spreads on Facebook. A recent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499\">Wall Street Journal report</a> found that Facebook’s leadership shut down efforts to make the site less divisive by shelving internal research on whether social media increases polarization. Facebook, and Zuckerberg in particular, have denied these claims and criticized the Journal’s reporting.   </p>\n<p id=\"fyTbfq\">Zuckerberg has vehemently disputed the notion that Facebook is polarizing its users, arguing that on the whole the platform brings people together. The auditors questioned that conclusion, saying they “do not believe that Facebook is sufficiently attuned to the depth of concern on the issue of polarization and the way that the algorithms used by Facebook inadvertently fuel extreme and polarizing content.” </p>\n<p id=\"yDkooA\">Under public pressure after the 2016 election, Facebook adjusted its News Feed’s algorithm so that it promotes posts from friends and family over news articles. Still, the auditors believe this wasn’t sufficient action and that “Facebook should do everything in its power to prevent its tools and algorithms from driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism, and that the company must recognize that failure to do so can have dangerous (and life-threatening) real-world consequences.” </p>\n<p id=\"2wPi9n\">Facebook can do this, the auditors say, not just by removing hateful content but also redirecting users “away from (rather than toward) extremist organizations” in the types of recommendations it makes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FUZSJt\">4) Covid-19 showed Facebook can effectively police harmful content when it wants to</h3>\n<p id=\"B5cTID\">The Covid-19 pandemic raised the stakes for how the company handles harmful content. Notably, in response to the pandemic, Facebook began to aggressively <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/31/21115589/coronavirus-wuhan-china-myths-hoaxes-facebook-social-media-tiktok-twitter-wechat\">take down misinformation related to Covid-19</a>, removing hundreds of thousands of false posts that Facebook identified as having the potential to cause <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/facebook-coronavirus-misinformation-takedowns\">imminent physical harm</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"bzVPIf\">This new approach contrasts starkly with how the company combats other types of misinformation, which Facebook has historically chosen not to act on. The report says that “Facebook has no qualms about reining in speech by the proponents of the anti-vaccination movement, or limiting misinformation about COVID-19, but when it comes to voting, Facebook has been far too reluctant to adopt strong rules to limit misinformation and voter suppression.”</p>\n<p id=\"Kb8Fqx\">Moderating pandemic-related content is also getting more complicated for the platform: As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/27/21270280/facebook-twitter-youtube-coronavirus-pandemic-misinformation-political-controversy-face-masks\">Recode’s Peter Kafka explained in late May</a>, the discussion around Covid-19 has evolved from a public health concern into a rancorous and partisan political debate that encompasses voting rights, state reopening plans, and the politics of wearing (or not wearing) masks. The report notes the majority of the 100,000 pieces of content between March and May taken down for violating its voter inference policies were related to Covid-19. </p>\n<h3 id=\"64iY0c\">5) The person Facebook hires to be its new civil rights executive needs real decision-making power</h3>\n<p id=\"so2Enp\">For years, civil rights leaders have pressured Facebook to create a role that would ensure that the company is thinking about whether its products and policies are treating people fairly. With the publication of this report, Facebook announced that it is creating a senior vice president on civil rights leadership role. But auditors say that isn’t enough. They want Facebook to create a “civil rights infrastructure.”</p>\n<p id=\"YYUYi3\">The audit recommends that the new vice president of civil rights should manage a team rather than work in a standalone position; they should have a mandatory say in key “decisions with civil rights implications,” such as whether or not to remove controversial posts from a politician. The auditors specifically said that the new vice president of civil rights “must be ‘in the room’ (meaning in direct dialogue with decision-makers) when decisions are being made and have direct conversations with leadership.”</p>\n<p id=\"ReEpfm\">Fewer than 10 people weighed in on Zuckerberg’s controversial final decision not to take down Trump’s post referencing “shooting” at protests, according to a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/2/21278405/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-internal-employee-q-a-defend-moderate-trump-looting-shooting-post\">transcript of an internal Facebook all-hands meeting Recode reported</a> on in June. Of the people Zuckerberg cited in the meeting, only one was Black, and none had roles dedicated exclusively to civil rights. </p>\n<p id=\"IH24Bc\">In a statement to Recode, Rashad Robertson, the president of Color of Change, said the newly announced position was “an important step” but added that “their office needs to be provided with full resources to be effective.”</p>\n<p id=\"sZvZBI\">“Without this, there is no reason to believe that Facebook will prioritize civil rights protections moving forward,” Robertson said. “All we can count on is Zuckerberg pontificating about free expression, while giving a free pass to politicians to lie, sow discord, and thrive off of hate and political chaos.” </p>\n<h3 id=\"yDHvzT\">What’s next</h3>\n<p id=\"YLUc8i\">For civil rights leaders who have been waiting on the results of this report for two years, the big question is what comes next. Will Facebook enact the many changes in this audit it has said it’s “considering” or “piloting”?</p>\n<p id=\"2Fv7mU\">Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, in her blog post <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/civil-rights-audit-report/\">announcing the audit’s release on Wednesday</a>, called it the “beginning of the journey — not the end” for Facebook’s handling of hate speech and related issues. But some civil rights organizations are losing patience, and according to the audit, some are considering stopping their work with Facebook altogether. This is an alarming sign, considering how close the November election is.  </p>\n<p id=\"WMuX5f\">“I’m not looking only for what the audit recommends, but what Facebook is going to do about it,” Jessica Gonzáles, president of civil rights organization Free Press, which has been one of the organizations leading an advertising boycott of Facebook, told Recode. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"N9qken\"><q>“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"sBlS4g\">Advertisers are continuing to sign on to the boycott, with around 125 new ones signing up so far this week alone, Gonzáles told Recode on Wednesday. Congress is also likely to press Facebook on these issues at an upcoming <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3114\">congressional hearing on antitrust issues</a> in July, during which Zuckerberg and other major tech executives are set to testify. </p>\n<p id=\"k4k7k5\">“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this,” said Gonzáles. “The actions don’t meet the words.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

      "contentSnippet": "Mark Zuckerberg testifies about how his company will handle false and misleading information by political leaders during the 2020 campaign before the House Financial Services Committee in October 2019. | Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\n  The new, deeply critical report highlights the tension between free expression and hate speech on the social network. Facebook has failed on civil rights. \nOn Wednesday, after two years of work, the social media giant finally released the results of its independent audit, a wide-ranging report on the state of civil rights on Facebook, from hate speech to advertising to algorithmic bias. The auditors found that the company simply hasn’t done enough to combat hate and abuse on its platform. \nFollowing up on two previous updates in December 2018 and June 2019, the audit concludes that the company’s handling of civil rights issues is “too reactive and piecemeal,” and ultimately raises doubts about whether Facebook is actually committed to addressing its myriad problems. \nThat’s especially concerning given that the November 2020 election is just months away.\nFormer ACLU director Laura W.

More than 1,000 companies have now signed on, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissing its impact. \nFor these leaders of the boycott, who have long tried to work alongside Facebook, the findings of the audit confirm much of what they’ve previously said about the company: that it isn’t taking issues around hate speech, bias, polarization, and diversity seriously enough. \n“Ridding the platform of hate and misinformation against Black people only became a priority when there was a PR crisis to endure,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, who hinted that Congress may have a role in protecting civil rights on the ever-embattled platform. \t\nThe report is an important one for Facebook’s reputation, but it isn’t binding.

Murphy wrote in the report’s introduction. “It will require hard balancing, but that kind of balancing of rights and interests has been part of the American dialogue since its founding and there is no reason that Facebook cannot harmonize those values, if it really wants to do so.”\n3) Hate speech is still a problem for Facebook, and we don’t know how bad it really is\nFacebook has long struggled with hateful and violent speech on its platform, including from white nationalists streaming talk shows on Facebook Watch and members of the “boogaloo movement” that promote anti-government ideology and has instigated violence at recent racial justice protests.\nFacebook’s audit highlights that the company has a long way to go in combating hate speech, particularly around white nationalism. Despite improvements Facebook has made some progress: It says it’s gotten better at identifying hate speech, and it now has a team of 350 people who work exclusively on combating dangerous groups on Facebook. But the auditors say hateful content often stays on the platform for longer than it should or doesn’t get removed in the first place. This is an “especially acute” problem with content targeting African Americans, Jews, and Muslims, according to the audit. \nFor example, the auditors asked Facebook to ban all content that promotes white nationalist or white separatist ideology, something Facebook has so far failed to do. The company has explicitly banned phrases like “white nationalism” or “white separatism,” but that simplistic approach still allows racist content to continue to spread on the platform, the auditors said. \nThe audit also criticized Facebook for not taking down hateful events fast enough. The report highlights how in 2019, it took Facebook over 24 hours to remove an event intended to physically intimidate attendees at the Islamic Society of North America’s annual meeting in Houston, Texas. Facebook has acknowledged its misstep with that incident, but auditors called for the company to fundamentally revise its review process to expedite the removal of such events. Properly moderating events, the report says, is essential “to ensure that people cannot use Facebook to organize calls to arms to harm or intimidate specific groups” during the current nationwide protests. \nOne thing complicating Facebook’s hate speech problem is the fact that there’s not enough hard data to know how bad it is or how it impacts different groups. The report says “the absence of data for analysis and study seems to undercut efforts to document and define the problem, identify its source, and explore potential mitigation.” \nWhile the audit focused on issues of hate speech, it also touched on a related and even more complex issue that has dogged Facebook for years: whether or not its platform politically polarizes its users and how this might be connected to the hate speech that spreads on Facebook. A recent Wall Street Journal report found that Facebook’s leadership shut down efforts to make the site less divisive by shelving internal research on whether social media increases polarization. Facebook, and Zuckerberg in particular, have denied these claims and criticized the Journal’s reporting.   \nZuckerberg has vehemently disputed the notion that Facebook is polarizing its users, arguing that on the whole the platform brings people together. The auditors questioned that conclusion, saying they “do not believe that Facebook is sufficiently attuned to the depth of concern on the issue of polarization and the way that the algorithms used by Facebook inadvertently fuel extreme and polarizing content.” \nUnder public pressure after the 2016 election, Facebook adjusted its News Feed’s algorithm so that it promotes posts from friends and family over news articles. Still, the auditors believe this wasn’t sufficient action and that “Facebook should do everything in its power to prevent its tools and algorithms from driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism, and that the company must recognize that failure to do so can have dangerous (and life-threatening) real-world consequences.” \nFacebook can do this, the auditors say, not just by removing hateful content but also redirecting users “away from (rather than toward) extremist organizations” in the types of recommendations it makes.\n4) Covid-19 showed Facebook can effectively police harmful content when it wants to\nThe Covid-19 pandemic raised the stakes for how the company handles harmful content. Notably, in response to the pandemic, Facebook began to aggressively take down misinformation related to Covid-19, removing hundreds of thousands of false posts that Facebook identified as having the potential to cause imminent physical harm. \nThis new approach contrasts starkly with how the company combats other types of misinformation, which Facebook has historically chosen not to act on. The report says that “Facebook has no qualms about reining in speech by the proponents of the anti-vaccination movement, or limiting misinformation about COVID-19, but when it comes to voting, Facebook has been far too reluctant to adopt strong rules to limit misinformation and voter suppression.”\nModerating pandemic-related content is also getting more complicated for the platform: As Recode’s Peter Kafka explained in late May, the discussion around Covid-19 has evolved from a public health concern into a rancorous and partisan political debate that encompasses voting rights, state reopening plans, and the politics of wearing (or not wearing) masks. The report notes the majority of the 100,000 pieces of content between March and May taken down for violating its voter inference policies were related to Covid-19. \n5) The person Facebook hires to be its new civil rights executive needs real decision-making power\nFor years, civil rights leaders have pressured Facebook to create a role that would ensure that the company is thinking about whether its products and policies are treating people fairly. With the publication of this report, Facebook announced that it is creating a senior vice president on civil rights leadership role. But auditors say that isn’t enough. They want Facebook to create a “civil rights infrastructure.”\nThe audit recommends that the new vice president of civil rights should manage a team rather than work in a standalone position; they should have a mandatory say in key “decisions with civil rights implications,” such as whether or not to remove controversial posts from a politician. The auditors specifically said that the new vice president of civil rights “must be ‘in the room’ (meaning in direct dialogue with decision-makers) when decisions are being made and have direct conversations with leadership.”\nFewer than 10 people weighed in on Zuckerberg’s controversial final decision not to take down Trump’s post referencing “shooting” at protests, according to a transcript of an internal Facebook all-hands meeting Recode reported on in June. Of the people Zuckerberg cited in the meeting, only one was Black, and none had roles dedicated exclusively to civil rights. \nIn a statement to Recode, Rashad Robertson, the president of Color of Change, said the newly announced position was “an important step” but added that “their office needs to be provided with full resources to be effective.”\n“Without this, there is no reason to believe that Facebook will prioritize civil rights protections moving forward,” Robertson said. “All we can count on is Zuckerberg pontificating about free expression, while giving a free pass to politicians to lie, sow discord, and thrive off of hate and political chaos.” \nWhat’s next\nFor civil rights leaders who have been waiting on the results of this report for two years, the big question is what comes next. Will Facebook enact the many changes in this audit it has said it’s “considering” or “piloting”?\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, in her blog post announcing the audit’s release on Wednesday, called it the “beginning of the journey — not the end” for Facebook’s handling of hate speech and related issues. But some civil rights organizations are losing patience, and according to the audit, some are considering stopping their work with Facebook altogether. This is an alarming sign, considering how close the November election is.  \n“I’m not looking only for what the audit recommends, but what Facebook is going to do about it,” Jessica Gonzáles, president of civil rights organization Free Press, which has been one of the organizations leading an advertising boycott of Facebook, told Recode. \n“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this”\nAdvertisers are continuing to sign on to the boycott, with around 125 new ones signing up so far this week alone, Gonzáles told Recode on Wednesday. Congress is also likely to press Facebook on these issues at an upcoming congressional hearing on antitrust issues in July, during which Zuckerberg and other major tech executives are set to testify. \n“I know that we can’t snap our fingers and transform a social media network in a day, but [Facebook has] been way too lethargic about this,” said Gonzáles. “The actions don’t meet the words.”\n\nSupport Vox’s explanatory journalism\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/\">June 25 Pew Research poll</a>, 71 percent of Americans say we should wear masks in public either most of the time or always. But it splits on a partisan level. Pew reported: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"4iw32D\">Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn always (63% vs. 29%). Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say that masks should rarely or never be worn (23% vs. 4%).</p>\n<p id=\"wzJ7eC\">Republicans also are less likely than Democrats to say they have worn masks in stores or other businesses always or most of the time in the past month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"KJf0HQ\">This happens in spite of directives and pleas from epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, scientists, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks\">World Health Organization</a> to continue wearing masks, continue washing your hands, and continue to practice social distance to help curb the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">coronavirus</a>. It’s also happening as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311347/arizona-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/6/21308351/california-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\">states</a> in the US report record-breaking numbers of new cases.</p>\n<p id=\"GM7917\">The shoppers-gone-wild videos make examples of these people, and are often accompanied by headlines like “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/06/14/maskless-karen-coughs-on-customer-inside-queens-bagel-shop/\">Maskless ‘Karen’ coughs on complaining customer in Queens bagel shop</a>” and “<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/karen-no-mask-videos-tantrums-coronavirus/\">8 Karens and Kens who threw huge tantrums instead of putting on masks</a>.” Their popularity and millions of views make it seem like everyone is on the same page about why this behavior is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"0rA4ej\">“I share this to say please choose kindness in these situations. Look out for one another like patrons who took this video and asked if I was okay,” Ally Goodbaum, a videographer who captured the “maskless Karen” who began coughing on her, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100595160750355\">wrote on Facebook in June</a>. “I know there are bigger problems in the nation right now but more and more it seems the people who are just trying to stand up for the right things are getting bulldozed by bullies.” </p>\n<p id=\"NYAhMT\">But if the meltdown content’s pro-mask agenda was effective, you’d think there’d be less and less of this behavior and less and less footage of it as time went on. The videos would have stopped after the first berserker got famous. Instead, there seem to be new ones posted every day.</p>\n<p id=\"5eoZrL\">It turns out, as satisfying as it is to watch someone reprimanded for bad behavior, the videos themselves might not be an effective tool to change attitudes toward public health. And according to health and behavior experts, changing someone’s mind about masks is much more difficult than embarrassing them on candid camera.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vYGV7M\">Why people love these mask freakout videos</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4tLB4NIoyiI67_e0SJXRaNd5-Y=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20074898/1251029880.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Win McNamee/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A vendor wearing a mask and face shield at Trump’s June 2020 rally in Tulsa.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"jBR074\">To fully understand these freakouts and the reactions they inspire means understanding the emotional state we — regardless of political affiliation — are all in. For the past four months, we’ve dealt with an entirely new reality wrapped around a deadly threat that we still don’t fully comprehend. That takes a toll on us emotionally, and we’re constantly coping with it.</p>\n<p id=\"jGwrin\">“From a psychological point of view, when there’s a massive unknown new threat, humans’ survival instinct triggers and they become highly vigilant and emotional,” David Abrams, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the <a href=\"https://publichealth.nyu.edu/faculty/david-abrams\">NYU School of Global Public Health</a>, told me. “You have the rug pulled from under you, and suddenly your instinct is immediately to become hyperalert. And as that adrenaline pumps, you get into what we call the fight or flight — an emotional response that overrides cool-headed rationality.”</p>\n<p id=\"3LxYoH\">This <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/vitality/202003/our-brains-coronavirus\">stress manifests</a> itself in different behaviors.</p>\n<p id=\"XPhLl7\">In my home, it manifested as copious amounts of dessert-scented hand soap (at the time, Bath &amp; Body Works was one of the few places with stock) and learning how to cook <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21222868/alison-roman-shallot-pasta-pandemic-cooking\">caramelized shallot pasta</a>. This was, as Abrams explained to me, completely natural.</p>\n<p id=\"FCwwnz\">“When [fight or flight in response to a threat] happens, you fall back on your instincts,” he said. “You become hypersensitive to messages from other people. You look around at what other people are doing and what your leaders are saying. You become a copycat to quickly latch onto something that someone else is doing. And you’re highly vulnerable because of your hypervigilance, and the threat is urgent.”</p>\n<p id=\"4qCle8\">An example Abrams cited was 9/11. After it occurred, we began — for better and worse — trusting our leaders and following new social rules like enhanced security screenings at airports. I still remember when we were allowed to walk our loved ones to the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"GhMStO\">The key part of Abrams’s explanation, though, is that the virus isn’t as concrete as a human terrorist — it certainly doesn’t win a moral victory when you put on a mask — and that in 2020 America, we all have different ideas about who we determine to be leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"3My169\">Following leadership cues can be helpful; those who see health officials and medical experts as leaders then copycat behavior that stamps down on the virus, like thoroughly washing hands, social distancing, and wearing masks. </p>\n<p id=\"x0iomt\">It also works the other way. That’s what makes, as Abrams cited, Vice President <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/28/21240245/mike-pence-mayo-clinic-visit-mask\">Mike Pence’s maskless visit to the Mayo Clinic</a> in April so important. Those who see him as a leader copy that behavior. Add to that other leaders who don’t wear masks and the predominantly conservative rhetoric about how they aren’t useful (see: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/21/21266413/coronavirus-face-masks-trump-cdc-n95\">Trump, Donald</a>) and it undermines the legitimacy and importance of health officials’ advice.</p>\n<p id=\"OWvEz0\">While following cues from those we trust isn’t the only determining factor in what kind of behavior we display, it’s a powerful one. Other factors, as sociologists and epidemiologists told me, include one’s sense of community, shifting social norms, and personal experiences (like losing a loved one to the virus).</p>\n<p id=\"iu7ehd\">Our own behaviors then become the same ones we want to see reflected in the world around us. And when they don’t, it sets up a clash.</p>\n<p id=\"xmTCG5\">The videos of people without masks freaking out, people in masks reacting to said freakouts, and the urge to share these clips all stem from what some sociologists believe is a release for all the frustration, hypervigilance, uncertainty, and stress that we’ve accumulated since the original lockdowns in March.</p>\n<p id=\"cGQgxx\">“Frustration leads to anger; it leads to resentment,” Gary Fine, a sociology professor at <a href=\"https://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/gary-alan-fine.html\">Northwestern University</a>, told me, explaining that because the virus isn’t tangible and the threat is invisible, it leads to humans lashing out at the most concrete target: each other. For people who hate masks, this means flying into a rage at those who encourage wearing them. For people who have made the commitment to masks, this may mean recording or watching the unmasked in an embarrassing situation.</p>\n<p id=\"qRpICR\">“So say you’re in a state of frustration, and you see someone who is doing something that you find unappealing, whatever that may be. Because we have cellphones with cameras in them, we can take these videos and we have social media and we can post those videos,” he continued.</p>\n<p id=\"3d65Wn\">The spectacle of the maskless throwing temper tantrums and getting thrown out of stores appeals to individuals and groups who generally wear masks because it feels like a little bit of justice. The videos also affirm a sense of in-group superiority, as both Abrams and Fine explained. They confirm to one group (mask wearers) that the other group (people who don’t wear masks) is incorrect. But aside from whatever karmic itch these videos might scratch, they’re largely ineffective at changing anyone’s behavior. </p>\n<h3 id=\"jz0W9w\">Shaming and scolding won’t change anyone’s mind about masks</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8SDGyEgZ4Ic0CsqomLZ8MrZlnE4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20074908/1254733200.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Wang Gang/China News Service via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A teacher and examinee high five in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"QirqRi\">Epidemiologists like Jared Baeten, the vice dean of the School of Public Health and professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the <a href=\"https://globalhealth.washington.edu/faculty/jared-baeten\">University of Washington</a>, know that shaming someone into acting “better” doesn’t really work.</p>\n<p id=\"tUNrnN\">Baeten’s background is in HIV. The HIV and AIDS pandemic (which still affects thousands of Americans today) is often used as an analogy when talking about the coronavirus because they’re both national infectious disease emergencies, and because of the emphasis on prevention. For both the coronavirus and HIV, experts prescribe a set of behaviors to curb the spread.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"b4U6xn\"><q>“An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"tFJYi6\">And one of the most important lessons gleaned from that pandemic is that shaming was detrimental.</p>\n<p id=\"tQ6Ty8\">“An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful,” Baeten told me. In the AIDS crisis, the corollary to masks could be condoms, which researchers learned were more successful when education didn’t stigmatize individuals. “[Effective] HIV prevention is much more about self-empowerment, individual decision-making, pleasure with safety than it was about dirty and shaming and bad. Scolding is a generally difficult public health strategy.”</p>\n<p id=\"J0oJpQ\">The problem with scolding and shame, according to all the experts I spoke to, is that individuals respond with resentment and anger. Those emotions are closely tied to defiance and withdrawal. It’s not unlike the research that shaming and scolding children is ultimately not very effective in changing behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"xpNU7k\">“It’s hurtful. It’s hurtful to the individual,” <a href=\"https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/bm2055\">Barun Mathema</a>, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, told me. “And it perhaps may have the opposite effect. I think we should sort of steer away from more caustic strategies of trying to force people into doing A or B. We know these sort of approaches don’t really work very effectively.” </p>\n<p id=\"GMUGbJ\">The benchmark public health officials want to hit with not just mask-wearing but all the other coronavirus precautions is for these behaviors to become a social norm. The tipping point of when something becomes a social norm has been a key, historically, in terms of public health.</p>\n<p id=\"Ads4L5\">A recent example: smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"p1HNoQ\">The more we learned about the deadly effects of cigarettes, the more we acted to curb smoking. When it was more socially acceptable, Americans pushed back against mandates that banned smoking in restaurants and bars. But that shifted to a point where not smoking became the dominant norm.</p>\n<p id=\"WBGKAJ\">“Smoking today is not viewed the way it perhaps was in the ’80s or ’90s,” Mathema said. “I wouldn’t say it was necessarily social shaming, but social acceptability, right? I think that has an impact on behavior.”</p>\n<p id=\"rJVGr5\">Seat belts, which Mathema also points to, went through a similar cultural tipping point (“Before a federal mandate came along, and even when that came along, there were a lot of people who said,<em> ‘</em>I don’t want to be strapped down. It’s my choice<em>,’” </em>he explains), but smoking is perhaps a closer corollary.

They all start in the middle.\nThe videos, blurry and shaky, look like the beginning of a found-footage movie, one of those horror flicks where you don’t know what you’re looking at it until it becomes impossible to miss. In this case, it’s a first-person point of view. Our cameraperson, a woman in Scottsdale, Arizona, is slapping masks out of a display.\n\n\nThis woman in Scottsdale, Arizona was super upset with Target for selling face masks. So upset in fact, that she attacked their display....pic.twitter.com/ye9LiDz0JH— Rex Chapman   (@RexChapman) July 5, 2020\n\n\n\n“This shit’s fucking over,” she says, again and again, her free hand slapping away mask after mask.\nPlastic crumples. The metal display screeches. The bottom of the video reads “@Target” in cheerful, rainbow-colored letters, seemingly unaware of the human-on-mask violence its director is unleashing.\nThat video, posted on July 5, currently has been played 9.9 million times.\nThe next day, a similar video appeared on the internet. A man at a Fort Myers, Florida, Costco, the beloved purveyor of discounted big-screen televisions and 30-roll packs of toilet paper, has gone into a rage. He wears a red shirt that reads, “Running the world since 1776.” His face, sharpened and angry, screams at our cameraperson. The caption explains that he’s been asked to put on a mask.\n“I feel threatened,” he shouts so hard his voice cracks. “Back off.”\n\n\nFlorida man at Fort Myers Costco in \"Running the World Since 1776\" shirt flips out on elderly woman who asked him to wear a mask and man who defended her #BecauseFlorida (via @profjaffar) pic.twitter.com/PDOvi33qHK— Billy Corben (@BillyCorben) July 7, 2020\n\n\n\nThese are two of the more recent additions to the genre of videos of people not wearing masks freaking out in public places over having to wear one. This expanding oeuvre includes a woman going ballistic in Trader Joe’s, another woman terrorizing bagel shop patrons by coughing on them, another throwing food, and an older, smaller man tumbling, belly-first, through a Walmart to assert his non-mask dominance:\n\n\nOkay imagine being this much of a Male #Karen lol#Boomer doesn't wanna wear a mask in the store; so he then Assaults the Employee and Trips and Falls  #KarensStrikeAgain #KarensGoneWild #Karens pic.twitter.com/W2dtL4AnD9— Chad of the CHAZ (@RealSaleemJuma) June 21, 2020\n\n\n\nWhile the antagonists are different, the message is the same: These people believe masks aren’t necessary and that they have the right to flagrantly disregard public health advice and guidelines.\nTheir frustration with masks seems to stem from the ongoing conservative politicization of masks as a liberal affectation having no basis in science. According to a June 25 Pew Research poll, 71 percent of Americans say we should wear masks in public either most of the time or always. But it splits on a partisan level. Pew reported: \n\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn always (63% vs. 29%). Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say that masks should rarely or never be worn (23% vs. 4%).\nRepublicans also are less likely than Democrats to say they have worn masks in stores or other businesses always or most of the time in the past month.\n\nThis happens in spite of directives and pleas from epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, scientists, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization to continue wearing masks, continue washing your hands, and continue to practice social distance to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. It’s also happening as several states in the US report record-breaking numbers of new cases.\nThe shoppers-gone-wild videos make examples of these people, and are often accompanied by headlines like “Maskless ‘Karen’ coughs on complaining customer in Queens bagel shop” and “8 Karens and Kens who threw huge tantrums instead of putting on masks.” Their popularity and millions of views make it seem like everyone is on the same page about why this behavior is bad.\n“I share this to say please choose kindness in these situations. Look out for one another like patrons who took this video and asked if I was okay,” Ally Goodbaum, a videographer who captured the “maskless Karen” who began coughing on her, wrote on Facebook in June. “I know there are bigger problems in the nation right now but more and more it seems the people who are just trying to stand up for the right things are getting bulldozed by bullies.” \nBut if the meltdown content’s pro-mask agenda was effective, you’d think there’d be less and less of this behavior and less and less footage of it as time went on. The videos would have stopped after the first berserker got famous. Instead, there seem to be new ones posted every day.\nIt turns out, as satisfying as it is to watch someone reprimanded for bad behavior, the videos themselves might not be an effective tool to change attitudes toward public health. And according to health and behavior experts, changing someone’s mind about masks is much more difficult than embarrassing them on candid camera.\nWhy people love these mask freakout videos\n  \n        \n      Win McNamee/Getty Images\n      A vendor wearing a mask and face shield at Trump’s June 2020 rally in Tulsa.\n  \nTo fully understand these freakouts and the reactions they inspire means understanding the emotional state we — regardless of political affiliation — are all in. For the past four months, we’ve dealt with an entirely new reality wrapped around a deadly threat that we still don’t fully comprehend. That takes a toll on us emotionally, and we’re constantly coping with it.\n“From a psychological point of view, when there’s a massive unknown new threat, humans’ survival instinct triggers and they become highly vigilant and emotional,” David Abrams, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the NYU School of Global Public Health, told me. “You have the rug pulled from under you, and suddenly your instinct is immediately to become hyperalert. And as that adrenaline pumps, you get into what we call the fight or flight — an emotional response that overrides cool-headed rationality.”\nThis stress manifests itself in different behaviors.\nIn my home, it manifested as copious amounts of dessert-scented hand soap (at the time, Bath & Body Works was one of the few places with stock) and learning how to cook caramelized shallot pasta. This was, as Abrams explained to me, completely natural.\n“When [fight or flight in response to a threat] happens, you fall back on your instincts,” he said. “You become hypersensitive to messages from other people. You look around at what other people are doing and what your leaders are saying. You become a copycat to quickly latch onto something that someone else is doing. And you’re highly vulnerable because of your hypervigilance, and the threat is urgent.”\nAn example Abrams cited was 9/11. After it occurred, we began — for better and worse — trusting our leaders and following new social rules like enhanced security screenings at airports. I still remember when we were allowed to walk our loved ones to the gate.\nThe key part of Abrams’s explanation, though, is that the virus isn’t as concrete as a human terrorist — it certainly doesn’t win a moral victory when you put on a mask — and that in 2020 America, we all have different ideas about who we determine to be leaders.\nFollowing leadership cues can be helpful; those who see health officials and medical experts as leaders then copycat behavior that stamps down on the virus, like thoroughly washing hands, social distancing, and wearing masks. \nIt also works the other way. That’s what makes, as Abrams cited, Vice President Mike Pence’s maskless visit to the Mayo Clinic in April so important. Those who see him as a leader copy that behavior. Add to that other leaders who don’t wear masks and the predominantly conservative rhetoric about how they aren’t useful (see: Trump, Donald) and it undermines the legitimacy and importance of health officials’ advice.\nWhile following cues from those we trust isn’t the only determining factor in what kind of behavior we display, it’s a powerful one. Other factors, as sociologists and epidemiologists told me, include one’s sense of community, shifting social norms, and personal experiences (like losing a loved one to the virus).\nOur own behaviors then become the same ones we want to see reflected in the world around us. And when they don’t, it sets up a clash.\nThe videos of people without masks freaking out, people in masks reacting to said freakouts, and the urge to share these clips all stem from what some sociologists believe is a release for all the frustration, hypervigilance, uncertainty, and stress that we’ve accumulated since the original lockdowns in March.\n“Frustration leads to anger; it leads to resentment,” Gary Fine, a sociology professor at Northwestern University, told me, explaining that because the virus isn’t tangible and the threat is invisible, it leads to humans lashing out at the most concrete target: each other. For people who hate masks, this means flying into a rage at those who encourage wearing them. For people who have made the commitment to masks, this may mean recording or watching the unmasked in an embarrassing situation.\n“So say you’re in a state of frustration, and you see someone who is doing something that you find unappealing, whatever that may be. Because we have cellphones with cameras in them, we can take these videos and we have social media and we can post those videos,” he continued.\nThe spectacle of the maskless throwing temper tantrums and getting thrown out of stores appeals to individuals and groups who generally wear masks because it feels like a little bit of justice. The videos also affirm a sense of in-group superiority, as both Abrams and Fine explained. They confirm to one group (mask wearers) that the other group (people who don’t wear masks) is incorrect. But aside from whatever karmic itch these videos might scratch, they’re largely ineffective at changing anyone’s behavior. \nShaming and scolding won’t change anyone’s mind about masks\n  \n        \n      Wang Gang/China News Service via Getty Images\n      A teacher and examinee high five in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.\n  \nEpidemiologists like Jared Baeten, the vice dean of the School of Public Health and professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington, know that shaming someone into acting “better” doesn’t really work.\nBaeten’s background is in HIV. The HIV and AIDS pandemic (which still affects thousands of Americans today) is often used as an analogy when talking about the coronavirus because they’re both national infectious disease emergencies, and because of the emphasis on prevention. For both the coronavirus and HIV, experts prescribe a set of behaviors to curb the spread.\n“An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful”\nAnd one of the most important lessons gleaned from that pandemic is that shaming was detrimental.\n“An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful,” Baeten told me. In the AIDS crisis, the corollary to masks could be condoms, which researchers learned were more successful when education didn’t stigmatize individuals. “[Effective] HIV prevention is much more about self-empowerment, individual decision-making, pleasure with safety than it was about dirty and shaming and bad. Scolding is a generally difficult public health strategy.”\nThe problem with scolding and shame, according to all the experts I spoke to, is that individuals respond with resentment and anger. Those emotions are closely tied to defiance and withdrawal. It’s not unlike the research that shaming and scolding children is ultimately not very effective in changing behavior.\n“It’s hurtful. It’s hurtful to the individual,” Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, told me. “And it perhaps may have the opposite effect. I think we should sort of steer away from more caustic strategies of trying to force people into doing A or B. We know these sort of approaches don’t really work very effectively.” \nThe benchmark public health officials want to hit with not just mask-wearing but all the other coronavirus precautions is for these behaviors to become a social norm. The tipping point of when something becomes a social norm has been a key, historically, in terms of public health.\nA recent example: smoking.\nThe more we learned about the deadly effects of cigarettes, the more we acted to curb smoking. When it was more socially acceptable, Americans pushed back against mandates that banned smoking in restaurants and bars. But that shifted to a point where not smoking became the dominant norm.\n“Smoking today is not viewed the way it perhaps was in the ’80s or ’90s,” Mathema said. “I wouldn’t say it was necessarily social shaming, but social acceptability, right? I think that has an impact on behavior.”\nSeat belts, which Mathema also points to, went through a similar cultural tipping point (“Before a federal mandate came along, and even when that came along, there were a lot of people who said, ‘I don’t want to be strapped down. It’s my choice,’” he explains), but smoking is perhaps a closer corollary. If I don’t wear my seat belt and I’m in an accident, it doesn’t really affect the person in the other car who’s wearing theirs. But if I’m smoking and exposing others to secondhand smoke, that may be more akin to spreading the virus.\nThe difficult thing for public health officials is that initiatives like seat belts and anti-smoking campaigns took a long time to get where they are today. They didn’t happen overnight. The coronavirus, on the other hand, needs to be dealt with immediately. States throughout the country are reporting record numbers of infection. And epidemiologists and medical experts are being asked to help get this message across to the public in a compressed amount of time.\nSo how do you change someone’s mind?\nAll the experts I spoke to pretty much said the same thing when it comes to changing someone’s mind about masks and public health in general: You have to be the bigger person, and you have to be empathetic.\nShaming someone into behaving better, while satisfying, doesn’t work. People respond better when they feel good and are respected. That means earnestly listening to someone’s concerns and their experiences.\n“You have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt, right? That if given all the right sort of information and the right context, people may come up with very similar decisions,” Mathema told me. “Personal circumstances are also very important. Are you talking to somebody who’s just lost a job? Who’s very stressed out? Or somebody who strongly believes in XYZ because of these reasons?”\n“You have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt”\nAn example: For the past few months of the pandemic, a narrative from right-wing pundits emerged pitting public health against the economy. Economic hardship then becomes tethered to public health, and it’s not unreasonable for someone who believes in this narrative to resent public health when facing economic hardship. Someone being laid off from their job because of the coronavirus could possibly see it as the fault of public health officials.

In short, the broad US left-of-center coalition appears to be aligning around a common climate policy vision. That vision is described in the following piece, first published on May 27.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"TC2Gvl\">\n<p id=\"DQBYIQ\">After the <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/2010-07-26-why-did-the-climate-bill-fail/\">ignominious failure of the Democratic climate change bill</a> in President Barack Obama’s first term — the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill that narrowly passed the House but never came to a vote in the Senate — what little unity there was on climate change within the Democratic coalition fractured. Everyone went their own way, furious at everyone else. </p>\n<p id=\"6UdOrk\">Democratic members of the House were angry at Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was angry at the climate movement, which was angry at the big mainstream green groups, which were angry at Obama, who was reduced to addressing climate change through regulations that President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/tracking-deregulation-in-the-trump-era/\">wound up repealing</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"jWkM0p\">In all, the decade of climate politics from 2008 to 2018 netted frustratingly little progress at the federal level or consensus about the path ahead. No one was happy, and no one agreed on what to do next. Robinson Meyer captured it well in a 2017 piece in the Atlantic: “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/there-is-no-democratic-plan-to-fight-climate-change/543981/\">Democrats Are Shockingly Unprepared to Fight Climate Change</a>.”</p>\n<p id=\"BoCLG5\">But something different has been happening lately, as groups across the left come together to hash out their differences on climate policy. It turns out they agree on quite a bit. In fact, for the first time in memory, there’s a broad alignment forming around a climate policy platform that is both ambitious enough to address the problem and politically potent enough to unite all the left’s various interest groups.</p>\n<p id=\"lsBl1g\">With the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">coronavirus</a> raging and the economy facing a bleak near-term future, there is more appetite than ever for something big, a vision of a better post-virus economy and society. And such a vision is taking shape on the left.</p>\n<p id=\"3yH3xS\">If presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were smart, he would embrace this vision, serve as its champion, and make a serious bid to unite the left behind him. And there are signs that he will try to do just that. It’s still a long shot, but there’s at least a chance that Democrats could go into the 2020 election with their act together on climate change. And who saw that coming? </p>\n<p id=\"N61yzd\">In this post, I’ll offer an account of the new climate alignment: how it came to be, what kinds of climate policies it contains, what it leaves out, and its prospects moving forward. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/28/21265416/joe-biden-climate-change-democrats-young-voters\">the next post</a>, I cover Biden’s climate strategy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"F27CLq\">The coming together of the climate left</h3>\n<p id=\"OpadwU\">After a decade of dissolution, work on climate policy development cranked back up in earnest around 2018. States where Democrats took control <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/15/18624294/renewable-energy-policy-cities-states\">passed climate and clean energy bills</a>. Every Democratic candidate for president produced ambitious <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/10/20851109/2020-democrats-climate-change-plan-president\">climate plans</a>. “All of those people who ran for president, who are currently sitting electeds, had a much more expanded vision on climate by the end of their campaigns than when they started,” said Maggie Thomas, who served as deputy climate director of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s campaign and then policy advisor to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJ1-LT5XRNOrmHfkwq2fzgQ0MEI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20000724/GettyImages_1146568856.jpg\">\n      <cite>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Gov. Jay Inslee met with solar workers while campaigning for president in San Francisco, California, in May 2019.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"U1hTLW\">Democrats in both the House and Senate drafted climate bills (the <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-leaders-release-draft-clean-future-act-legislative-text-to-achieve-a-100\">CLEAN Future Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-carper-and-others-introduce-the-clean-economy-act-of-2020\">Clean Economy Act</a>, respectively), and the <a href=\"https://climatecrisis.house.gov/\">House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis</a>, which has been holding hearings all year, is expected to release its recommendations this summer. </p>\n<p id=\"f3i6Af\">Perhaps most notably, behind the scenes, nonprofits on the left began a flurry of climate policy conclaves and discussions — often across factional lines, involving mainstream groups, left groups, environmental justice groups, and unions — to try to determine where there was consensus and where disagreements remained.</p>\n<p id=\"X8BNQA\">A few of these groups and efforts are worth mentioning. There was the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Green New Deal</a>, which burst onto the scene in November 2018 and utterly transformed the climate discussion, though it was a bit light on concrete policy. The US Climate Action Network convened a policy process that ended up involving more than 175 people from at least 106 separate groups across the climate-concerned spectrum; this May, it produced the surprisingly substantial <a href=\"https://equitableclimateaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vision-for-Equitable-Climate-Action-May-2020-final-1.pdf\">Vision for Equitable Climate Action</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"NbEUmi\">The BlueGreen Alliance, a group that brings together environmentalists and labor, developed “<a href=\"https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/work-issue/solidarity-for-climate-action/\">Solidarity for Climate Action</a>,” the first serious climate platform to get a sign-off from United Steelworkers. The <a href=\"https://ajustclimate.org/\">Equitable &amp; Just National Climate Platform</a> was developed by a long list of environmental justice groups alongside some bigger players like the League of Conservation Voters. Finally, in April, the brain trust behind Inslee’s gold-standard climate campaign plan spun up a group called <a href=\"https://www.evergreenaction.com/\">Evergreen Action</a> to advocate for it. </p>\n<p id=\"3ZR6VM\">Over the past few weeks, I have talked to more than a dozen people involved in this extraordinary burst of policy discussion and development. Just about every one of them made a point of commenting on the degree of comity and good faith shown thus far, even across some traditionally tense factional lines. </p>\n<p id=\"ubjw8G\">“Having groups all work together on a national climate policy platform — people from different regions, environmental stressors, gender identities, races — really did help to build alignment and trust,” Lindsay Harper, executive director of the environmental justice group Georgia WAND and co-chair of the US Climate Action Network process, told me. </p>\n<p id=\"BLI7Al\">Because policy development did not begin within a legislative process, it was not bound from the outset by compromise. Thanks in part to the Green New Deal, it began in imagination and aspiration. And it uncovered more and deeper agreement on climate policy than anyone might have predicted a few years ago. Though plenty of issues remain to be addressed, the broad left-of-center appears aligned around rapid decarbonization through stringent sector-specific standards, large-scale public investments, and a commitment to justice (“SIJ,” in my unwieldy acronym).</p>\n<aside id=\"RG5LvH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"“It’s young people, it’s their future”: Inside the Sunrise Movement’s bid to save the world\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/9/10/20847401/sunrise-movement-climate-change-activist-millennials-global-warming\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"DlrMTt\">“After more than 20 years of working in and with the progressive movement, I’m more cynical than most about prospects for unity on the left,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance. “But I’m increasingly hopeful that we can unify the movement’s factions, and all Democrats, around a policy agenda that frames climate action as industrial policy geared toward rebuilding America’s infrastructure and manufacturing base, with justice and equity baked in rather than an optional ingredient.”</p>\n<p id=\"zOWzzF\">Before getting into SIJ’s constitutive parts, it is worth discussing a few of the principles that have guided its development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DChUBe\">Net-zero emissions by 2050 is the new baseline</h3>\n<p id=\"OBSyt7\">The first has to do with the explosive impact of the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/\">2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC). That report examined the difference in impact between a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures and a 2°C rise. Spoiler: It is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17951924/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-takeaways\">huge and disastrous</a>. The IPCC concluded that to limit temperatures to 1.5°C would require the entire world to reach net-zero carbon emissions, emitting no more than it is absorbing, by midcentury. (It also concluded that most countries are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/11/26/20983626/climate-change-un-emissions-gap-report\">far off track</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"hwcKOd\">That goal — net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — has become table stakes, the new baseline for US climate policy. Virtually every candidate and climate platform mentioned above endorses it. Democrats in both houses of Congress endorse it. Even the American Conservation Coalition, a politically conservative group of young people concerned about climate change, <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052020/young-republican-conservative-climate-activism-green-new-deal\">endorses it</a>. Now net zero by 2050 is what it means to “address climate change.” </p>\n<p id=\"cqyAT9\">That is an enormous change in climate politics, inconceivable even a few years ago.</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\"><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-lVFYkKoN-0m_o7UKjVB-n8RGY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20000773/GettyImages_1200788338.jpg\">\n      <cite>NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>The Extinction Rebellion movement led a direct action protest in London in February 2020.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETe6cr3YVPfdMSg1k_55ajKIG_s=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20000774/GettyImages_1200788324.jpg\">\n      <cite>David Cliff/NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Several such coordinated global protests are set to continue throughout 2020.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"AujQKl\">Some groups, like the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have led <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18511491/climate-change-protests-london-extinction-rebellion\">civil disobedience actions</a> in cities around the world, argue that wealthy countries like the UK and the US should decarbonize by 2030 to allow more time for developing countries to catch up. Initially, some left groups in the US, including the youth-oriented Sunrise Movement, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/30/18522680/beto-orourke-2020-climate-change-proposal\">argued the same thing</a>. But that demand more or less faded into the background as it became clear that very few groups or candidates, if any, would endorse it.</p>\n<p id=\"KudCDN\">Though some activists might still wish for an earlier target, net zero by 2050 is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/3/21045263/climate-change-1-5-degrees-celsius-target-ipcc\">incredibly ambitious</a>. It will require a large-scale, rapid transition, driven by policy. Many of the people and groups endorsing it do not seem to fully comprehend this yet, but if you work backward from net zero by 2050, you arrive at policy radicalism. There’s no avoiding it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IwPVpy\">Republicans aren’t going to help</h3>\n<p id=\"d0cuJL\">The second principle is that Republicans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/26/18512213/climate-change-republicans-conservatives\">aren’t going to help</a>. There are still some centrist groups that pursue bipartisan cooperation on climate, and groups of (retired, young, or otherwise not in power) conservatives that will talk to them. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump have convinced the vast majority of people on the left that there is simply nothing to be gained by pursuing Republican cooperation. For the foreseeable future, Democrats will achieve on climate change <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/15/18624294/renewable-energy-policy-cities-states\">whatever they can achieve on their own</a>, however little it may prove to be.

For one thing, there’s the political economy: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/26/11470804/carbon-tax-political-constraints\">Raising prices is unpopular</a>, and raising prices enough, fast enough, to hit the 2050 target will be an almost insuperable political challenge. Cap and trade is still in the reputational toilet. Carbon taxes never saw the bipartisan support their backers always promised. The politics of carbon pricing just don’t seem to be going anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"u17CWq\">“The debate about whether a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax is the right solution for this crisis has completely gone out the window,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EnaWo5JEn66Xjz0pByrsONJAog=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20000838/AP_20012741027212.jpg\">\n      <cite>Andrew Harnik/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash at a climate rally in January 2020. </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"oD1XkB\">There is still room for pricing in climate policy (if environmental justice concerns are taken into account), but the dream of having one simple plan that solves the climate problem is, at least on the left, dead. It is now clear, if only from the experience of states that have actually passed legislation, that something more pragmatic and targeted, something more like <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/green-new-deal-economic-principles/582943/\">industrial policy</a>, is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"VVSyao\">So with those principles in mind, let’s look at the three pillars of the new SIJ alignment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SKip8P\">Standards: Electricity, cars, and buildings</h3>\n<p id=\"oaqmzS\">An economy the size of America’s is unlikely to fully decarbonize by 2030. There are sectors of the economy (think <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/10/20904213/climate-change-steel-cement-industrial-heat-hydrogen-ccs\">heavy industry</a>) where clean alternatives are not yet fully developed and economically competitive. It will take some time to work them out. </p>\n<p id=\"XQdj9W\">But it is vitally important that the US make rapid progress in those sectors where clean alternatives are available and just need to be scaled up. Primarily, that means electricity, cars, and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"g09MCn\">Together, those sectors make up close to two-thirds of US emissions. The core of any aggressive 10-year mobilization on climate must be to target them, not sideways through a carbon price, but directly, through sector-specific performance standards and incentives, to drive out the carbon as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"jFASfp\">Though the details differ, this basic electricity-cars-buildings approach can be found in recent legislation from states like Colorado, Washington, and California. It was the part of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/4/18527458/climate-change-jay-inslee-for-president-2020\">Inslee’s climate plan</a> (by 2030, a net-zero electricity sector, no new fossil fuel cars sold, and no new fossil-fueled buildings built) that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-climate-change-plan.html\">Warren subsequently adopted as her own</a>. Sanders had his own, characteristically <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/22/20827396/bernie-sanders-2020-climate-policy-green-new-deal\">turbocharged version</a>. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg had a version that achieved aggressive targets in those sectors <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/12/17/21023873/mike-bloomberg-climate-change-policy-power-natural-gas-coal\">entirely through executive action</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"G7NYUK\">The same standards-based approach was at the heart of the Green New Deal and has found a place in virtually every green group climate platform and both the House Democrats’ CLEAN Future Act and the Senate Democrats’ Clean Economy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"x9qxwV\">The policies are not identical. In electricity, Evergreen <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/4/18527458/climate-change-jay-inslee-for-president-2020\">calls</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.rff.org/publications/issue-briefs/clean-energy-standards/\">clean energy standard</a> (CES) to hit net zero by 2030. Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/12/17/21023873/mike-bloomberg-climate-change-policy-power-natural-gas-coal\">promised</a> 80 percent emission reductions in the sector using only strengthened EPA authorities, including a souped-up version of Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The Vision for Equitable Climate Action <a href=\"http://equitableclimateaction.org/\">endorses</a> 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 (rather than net-zero carbon, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/1/15/18181678/green-new-deal-100-percent-renewable-energy-nuclear-ccs\">more permissive standard</a> that most states have adopted). The CLEAN Act also <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Section-by-Section%20of%20CLEAN%20Future%20Act%20.pdf\">proposed</a> a CES, but it targets carbon neutrality in the sector by 2050 and includes a credit-trading scheme. </p>\n<p id=\"VDKueu\">There is similar variety in policy on cars and buildings. The Evergreen platform would crank up fuel economy standards to ensure that all new vehicles sold in the US are zero-emission by 2030. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/chuck-schumer-electric-car.html\">proposed</a> a plan to make all vehicles on US roads clean by 2040, combining trade-in incentives and grants for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Recommendations on buildings range from updating codes to decarbonizing all federally owned properties to launching a massive national energy-retrofit program.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Denver’s popular electric buses produce no local air pollution.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NWButonHoCxGfqesdbRitzCCCI=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20002985/GettyImages_1148837611.jpg\">\n      <cite>RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Denver’s popular electric buses produce no local air pollution.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"702BIY\">The details vary, but there is a strong common core: performance standards and incentives for the three biggest emitting sectors, aimed at making rapid, substantial progress on emissions in the next 10 years. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything\">ultimate vision</a> is a carbon-free electricity sector powering an electrified, emission-free vehicle fleet and building stock.</p>\n<p id=\"ER4OWw\">“We know from state-level action that clean energy standards are driving the most significant and sustained emissions reductions,” Thomas said. “So let’s scale that up, apply it nationally.” </p>\n<h3 id=\"MUvBd9\">Investment: We can have nice things</h3>\n<p id=\"lPWjnl\">One idea that the Green New Deal revitalized on the left is large-scale public investment. That idea is not new, but something about the moment — the rising danger of climate change, the growing influence of Sanders-style democratic socialism, the pent-up public need after decades of austerity politics — made it resonate. </p>\n<p id=\"QUYWDB\">The former Democratic presidential candidates <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/10/20851109/2020-democrats-climate-change-plan-president\">got the message</a>. Sanders put forward the largest bid: $16.3 trillion in public investments over 10 years. Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro came in at $10 trillion, Jay Inslee at $9 trillion, Cory Booker at $3 trillion, Amy Klobuchar between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, and Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg at around $2 trillion. (With the exception of Sanders, most of those numbers represent not only public money but also private investment pulled forward by public spending.)</p>\n<p id=\"aaAXew\">Public investment plays a huge role in the <a href=\"https://www.bluegreenalliance.org/work-issue/solidarity-for-climate-action/\">BlueGreen Alliance platform</a> and the <a href=\"https://ajustclimate.org/\">Equitable and Just National Climate Platform</a>. Oregon Rep. Peter DiFazio is still pushing his <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2020/04/defazio-house-democrats-seek-760-billion-infrastructure-bill-next-phase-of-coronavirus-relief.html\">$760 billion infrastructure bill</a> and there are substantial infrastructure investments in the Clean Economy Act. </p>\n<p id=\"WDJT8B\">A wide range of investments are recommended by these platforms, everything from a national green bank (Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Chris Murphy have <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-cosponsors-green-bank-act-to-create-jobs-reclaim-american-clean-energy-leadership\">sponsored a bill to create one</a>) to rural electrification, universal broadband, long-distance electricity transmission, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. </p>\n<p id=\"GhBGnZ\">The investment ideas cover a wide range, but the focus in all of them is supporting green industries, manufacturing, and research, and, above all, creating jobs. </p>\n<p id=\"ckzqC5\">And not just any jobs: well-paying, high-quality jobs. Which brings us to our third category.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Oy2sut\">Justice: For unions, fossil fuel workers, and front-line communities</h3>\n<p id=\"AGVQCi\">Unions, hard-hit fossil fuel communities, and vulnerable front-line communities have not always been prioritized in climate policy discussions, but this time around, in a break with past practice, they have been at the table from the beginning, helping to shape the policy platform.</p>\n<p id=\"Jn3gEL\">In part, this reflects a moral imperative — past transitions in the economy have tended to come at the expense of workers and vulnerable communities. But it also reflects a political imperative. Remember, the strategy here is to unite the left, pulling together a coalition that extends beyond traditional environmental groups and demographics. To do that, climate advocates will need both the environmental justice movement (one of the left’s fastest rising forces) and unions (one of the left’s most powerful existing forces) on board.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHYsKqMXeBYifiIl2yEZdwYRe6U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003314/AP_20107837992046.jpg\">\n      <cite>Mead Gruver/AP</cite>\n      <figcaption>Wyoming Mining Association executive director Travis Deti, pictured working from his home in Cheyenne on April 13, has been calling for help for the coal industry in the form of lower federal royalties and other aid due to the decreased demand for coal during the coronavirus crisis.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"GpJU3n\">That won’t be easy. Those groups have demands of climate policy that are not always commensurate, and relations between them — and between each of them and the climate movement — are still somewhat tentative and fragile. </p>\n<p id=\"sCDwgq\">Nonetheless, putting justice first represents the most notable shift in green thinking and strategy over the past decade, and it has uncovered a few elements that draw broad support.</p>\n<p id=\"FcumKe\"><strong>1. Unions</strong></p>\n<p id=\"10hGQA\">Last year, Washington state passed a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/18/18363292/washington-clean-energy-bill\">100 percent clean energy bill</a> that offered tax incentives to clean energy projects, but it made the incentives contingent on project labor standards. Projects paying prevailing wages could get 75 percent of the value of the incentives; to get 100 percent, they had to sign a “community workforce agreement or project labor agreement,” agreeing to a package of wages and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"8kucBB\">“Washington’s 100 percent clean law is just five months old and is already leading several developers to opt for union workers, including a 144 MW wind farm and others in development,” said Vlad Gutman, Washington director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions. “The renewable industry isn’t new here, but these will be some of the first projects built by unions. We’re happy to see the law working as intended.”</p>\n<p id=\"7vYl4H\">Climate advocates want to take such ideas to the national level. Evergreen’s climate plan proposes to “reunionize and empower workers in every industry with new tools to collectively bargain.” It would repeal “right to work” laws, amend the National Labor Relations Act to make it easier to unionize, step up enforcement of labor laws, raise the minimum wage, modernize overtime laws, and much more. Virtually every Democratic candidate stressed the creation of “union-friendly jobs.” </p>\n<p id=\"Lrhi1O\">The BlueGreen Alliance recommends the “application of strong Buy American and Davis-Bacon requirements, as well as utilization of project labor agreements, for all public spending, and procurement policies that ensure the use of domestic, clean, and safe materials made by law-abiding corporations throughout the supply chain.”</p>\n<p id=\"EB62I0\">The Vision for Equitable Climate Action recommends policies that require any jobs created by public investments to “abide by high-road labor standards, with unions, frontline communities, and other impacted local populations taking the lead on developing these policies, such as prevailing wages, strict safety standards, and project labor agreements with unions.” The Equitable and Just National Climate Platform stresses “high-quality jobs with family-sustaining wages and safe and healthy working conditions.” </p>\n<p id=\"QPFTkJ\">One of the reasons unions have traditionally been suspicious of climate campaigners is that, despite all the flowery talk about a “just transition,” in reality, the jobs being created by the clean energy economy pay less and are less likely to be unionized. Across the left, there is a shared recognition that public policy should aim to change that.</p>\n<p id=\"aLlZFq\"><strong>2. Fossil fuel communities</strong></p>\n<p id=\"Bnqmq0\">Similarly, communities dependent on fossil fuel jobs do not yet believe they will find equal or better livelihoods in a clean energy economy. They, too, have heard a lot of pretty talk, but the reality, from Appalachia to the shale fields of North Dakota to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/7/9/20684815/coal-wyoming-bankruptcy-blackjewel-appalachia\">coal mines of Wyoming</a>, is that the loss of fossil fuel jobs tends to leave behind economic wreckage.</p>\n<p id=\"ad3Z92\">Democrats have been at least fitfully trying to help. Obama had a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/13/9148975/kentucky-town-coal-obama\">comprehensive plan to help these communities</a>, but the Republican Senate didn’t pass it. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 platform included a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/15/16306158/hillary-clinton-hall-of-mirrors\">$30 billion aid package to impacted coal communities</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"m6eRe6\">But putting emissions first and adding something for workers as an afterthought “is just the wrong order of operations,” Prakash said. “I think people are starting to get that. We’re seeing people foreground equity and frontload a plan for worker transition.”</p>\n<p id=\"HYX670\">Evergreen’s plan, for instance, contains a “G.I. Bill for impacted fossil fuel workers and communities” that would guarantee the retirement, pension, and health care benefits of all affected fossil fuel workers and provide them with ongoing income support and retraining opportunities. That’s the scale of intervention necessary to truly keep fossil fuel workers whole. And it’s probably much less expensive, economically and politically, than forever trying to overcome the opposition of fossil fuel communities.</p>\n<p id=\"GvSpho\">Similar prioritization of worker transition can be found across climate platforms on the left. It is not an afterthought anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"5nj33W\"><strong>3. Front-line communities</strong></p>\n<p id=\"fADPCn\">The idea of environmental justice grows out of the simple fact that virtually every environmental harm disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable communities: low-income communities, communities of color, indigenous communities, and so on. They are more likely to live next to roads and industrial facilities; breathe the most pollution, indoors and out; suffer most from industrial waste; depend most on public transit ... the list goes on.</p>\n<p id=\"9qo5uz\">Environmental justice has been around on the periphery of the green movement for years, struggling to get real recognition and resources. But again, something about the moment, particularly the impact of the Green New Deal and the strength of the resurgent left, has vaulted it to the center. Rather than doing something for or about environmental justice communities, greens are making policy <em>with</em> them, around the same table. As Harper told me, “if you are down with equity, you’ve got to give us space.”</p>\n<p id=\"L7fp6b\">The best example of this is the Equitable &amp; Just National Climate Platform, which pulled together big national green groups and environmental justice groups. “It has been a good process, a just process,” said Michele Roberts of <a href=\"https://ej4all.org/\">Environmental Justice Health Alliance</a>, which was involved in the work. “It’s been a very intentional building of relationships, a very intentional dive into everything from policies to the alignment of resources.” </p>\n<p id=\"4HareW\">That platform is the place to go to see the full range of environmental justice concerns and recommendations, from clean air and water to access to affordable energy to wealth-building and anti-displacement efforts. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\"><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJ6Qe67n8c-dXk-i9ecg6UvkNA8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003610/GettyImages_1164298758.jpg\">\n      <cite>Karla Ann Cote/NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Protesters marched in Newark, New Jersey, on August 26, 2019, to bring attention to the water crisis gripping the city.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEnUK59thRUFEoTTqcstWeovLYk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003612/GettyImages_1164298753.jpg\">\n      <cite>Karla Ann Cote/NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Areas in Newark have had drinking water lead levels higher than in Flint, Michigan.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"yv6b6f\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/10/14/20880701/2020-democratic-debates-climate-change-vulnerable-communities\">Every Democratic candidate</a> addressed the issue; Warren had what was probably the <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/environmental-justice\">most detailed plan</a>. The House’s CLEAN Future Act has an entire title (<a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Section-by-Section%20of%20CLEAN%20Future%20Act%20.pdf\">VI</a>) devoted to environmental justice, and the Senate’s Clean Economy Act was written, <a href=\"https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/leahy-carper-and-others-introduce-the-clean-economy-act-of-2020\">according to its authors</a>, to “address the cumulative environmental effects in economically distressed communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities.”</p>\n<p id=\"M77ZWG\">“Our climate action plan will prioritize investment where it is most needed,” said Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, the chair of the Select Committee, “including rural and deindustrialized areas, low-income communities, and communities of color.”</p>\n<p id=\"SLFU42\">Once again, the policy details differ. Some common recommendations include better “equity mapping” to identify vulnerable communities, an “equity screen” on all public investments to ensure that they go first to vulnerable communities, and high-level environmental justice committees in the White House, EPA, and/or DOJ.</p>\n<p id=\"HpIlYy\">These measures will build on work already happening in the Democratic caucus. “You see other pieces happening on Capitol Hill such as the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2PvXHFr\">Environmental Justice for All Act</a> with <a href=\"https://grijalva.house.gov/press-releases/following-yearlong-collaborative-effort-chair-grijalva-and-rep-mceachin-introduce-landmark-environmental-justice-legislation/\">Congressman [Raúl] Grijalva</a>,” Roberts said. “And you see momentum in the work of Sen.

Support more work like this.\",\"label\":\"Contribute\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/pages/support-now\"}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"dsoGZD\">A common vision, not a compromise</h3>\n<p id=\"M1Sq1q\">So that’s the alignment, at least at a high level. “It was the culmination of all the candidates trying to outdo one another,” said Thomas. “Now the best of those ideas are out there and the party is coalescing.”</p>\n<p id=\"wB9wYE\">“Standards, investment, and justice,” she said, “are the future of federal climate policy.”</p>\n<p id=\"s1iF63\">SIJ is not quite as compact or easy to explain as a carbon tax. One of the consequences of giving up on carbon pricing as a silver bullet is that you end up with silver buckshot — lots of smaller policies that add up to sufficiency. </p>\n<p id=\"ihZKwx\">The disaggregated nature of the policy has substantial political benefits, though. It was never easy to explain to industries or individuals how they would be affected by a complicated, indirect system of carbon credits, trading, and offsets — ask anyone involved in the 2009 Waxman-Markey fight. Because it is more sector-specific and investment-focused, the effects and benefits of SIJ for particular constituencies are easier to trace and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"0KLRRE\">It is likely to be more resilient than a single national program as well. The breadth of the SIJ approach is meant to infuse climate as a focus throughout the government, not just in one agency or policy, so that if any individual part of it is blocked or rolled back, all is not lost. </p>\n<p id=\"fLZKZ2\">And finally, whereas cap and trade or any other one-ring-to-rule-them-all climate policy must be passed in Congress, where Republican use of the Senate filibuster continues to make everything impossible, a great deal of SIJ policy can be accomplished in other ways. Much of the standards and justice pieces could be done through the executive powers of the president and federal agencies. </p>\n<p id=\"TdwbH9\">And the investment piece could be tackled in a stimulus bill (assuming Republicans allow a Democratic president to pass a stimulus bill) or — because it’s purely about spending and not about standards or regulatory changes — through a process called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvergreenAction/status/1260916374928388097\">budget reconciliation</a>, which requires only a bare majority in the Senate. </p>\n<p id=\"dGp4Vf\">In other words, there’s a great deal in the SIJ framework for which a president can be held accountable, even with an uncooperative Congress. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"0oP1dD\"><q>“Standards, investment, and justice are the future of federal climate policy”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"BEepEb\">Best of all, the SIJ framework emerged organically, from the ground up. “Through our stakeholder outreach and hearings,” said Castor, “we’ve found broad consensus for a climate plan that’s centered on building and rebuilding America’s infrastructure and creating a new generation of secure, middle-class jobs, all while enacting commonsense policies that support a clean energy economy and reinvigorate American manufacturing.”</p>\n<p id=\"cL7MWB\">The SIJ platform is robust and would constitute an ambitious climate program on its own. However, it doesn’t contain everything. There are still significant issues that don’t command full agreement across the left, that remain to be worked out.</p>\n<p id=\"gXZgai\">I will list some of those outstanding issues, from closest to consensus to furthest. To be clear: I’m not arguing that the items on this list are bad policies or even bad politics. They may still find a place in comprehensive federal climate policy. But there are intra-left conflicts around them that remain to be resolved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TUdhKG\">Accountability for fossil fuel companies</h3>\n<p id=\"3Co0GZ\">This one is extremely popular across the left. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/14/20908335/2020-democratic-debates-climate-change-fossil-fuel-companies-lawsuits\">Every Democratic candidate supports it</a>, along with almost every nonprofit climate platform. </p>\n<p id=\"pNPDBk\">The idea is that fossil fuel companies have known for a long time that their products are harming public health and have done everything in their power to cover it up, including funneling untold amounts of money into the political system and running some extremely deceptive public campaigns. Still, today, they are heavily subsidized and financed by public and private institutions that ignore their growing risks.</p>\n<p id=\"ZpFy7l\">There are three policy avenues that fall under the broad rubric of accountability.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T25SSAd15mRLbZAyX0KK0PyToZE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003683/GettyImages_1216660324.jpg\">\n      <cite>Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>President Trump holds a roundtable meeting with energy sector CEOs in the Cabinet Room of the White House on April 3, 2020.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"KGGK1F\">The first is supporting the growing number of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/22/17140166/climate-change-lawsuit-exxon-juliana-liability-kids\">lawsuits against fossil fuel companies</a>. Sen. Kamala Harris especially <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20847387/kamala-harris-2020-climate-change-policy\">emphasized this in her plan</a>, playing on her history as a prosecutor, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/11/12/20959293/bernie-sanders-climate-lawsuit-exxon-juliana-sinnok\">as did Sanders</a>, playing on his history as an anti-corporate crusader, but virtually all the Democratic candidates (including Biden) agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"RucJdn\">The second is taking steps to reform the financial system to force financial institutions to better account for the growing risks of fossil fuels in their investment decisions. (This<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/2/7/21127596/climate-change-financial-sector-dodd-frank-risk\"> post </a>has the policy details.) </p>\n<p id=\"LwB1CC\">The third is ending fossil fuel subsidies, something practically everyone says they want to do, and has said they want to do for decades, but never manages to actually do. (See <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/6/16428458/us-energy-coal-oil-subsidies\">this post</a> for more on the breadth of those subsidies.) </p>\n<p id=\"cYCrdC\">The only reason I didn’t include accountability in the alignment above is that direct confrontation with fossil fuel companies still makes some quarters of the left uncomfortable, especially more conservative Democrats and some parts of labor.</p>\n<p id=\"tdRw74\">Speaking of which ...</p>\n<h3 id=\"xiqToO\">Keep it in the ground</h3>\n<p id=\"gWm4OQ\">Supply-side climate efforts — attempting to directly restrict the mining, drilling, and transportation of fossil fuels — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/11/8/9690654/keystone-climate-activism\">exploded in popularity</a> in the wake of the 2010 Waxman-Markey failure and have been a key organizing axis for the climate movement ever since, helping it ally with affected communities and grow its grassroots reach.</p>\n<p id=\"EpWR0T\">Such efforts have won the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/3/17187606/fossil-fuel-supply\">grudging respect of some wonks</a> and the support of more left-leaning Democrats, including Sanders, Warren, Inslee, Steyer, and even Bloomberg. (Honest, he is left-leaning on climate!)</p>\n<p id=\"A02dqf\">Biden has sent mixed rhetorical signals about supply-side policy, but his <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/climate/\">platform</a> includes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” and “modifying royalties to account for climate costs,” two key requests of supply-siders.</p>\n<p id=\"sKTQ3j\">It is not always clear what the policy stakes of this debate are. Activists have pushed for a national <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/12/20857196/democratic-debate-climate-change-fracking-ban\">ban on fracking</a>, but that’s not something a president can do (most fracking is on private land) and it’s not something any Congress will do. The president can control fossil fuel projects on public land, but most available policy tools go after supply indirectly by reducing demand.</p>\n<p id=\"0yXlEj\">It’s clear that some kind of supply-side effort is a shared priority across the left and is likely to be part of the Democratic platform. The limiting, or at least complicating, factor is unions, specifically the old-line industrial unions, the steelworkers and pipe fitters who make good money working on drilling rigs and pipeline projects and don’t want to see them blocked or canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"VeUYLB\">They do not constitute a majority of unionized workers. The service sector unions — the health care workers, teachers, and public service employees — are larger and growing the fastest, and they are generally more climate-friendly. But the old-line unions have disproportionate political influence and command the loyalty, or at least fear, of many Democrats.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HzFGuW\">Carbon pricing</h3>\n<p id=\"6H2beZ\">Most Democratic candidates and Democrats in Congress still include some kind of price on carbon in their plans, including Sanders and Inslee. There are still people fixated on a carbon price as the One True Climate Policy, and parts of the climate left that have <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/carbon-pricing-green-new-deal-fossil-fuel-environment\">turned on it completely</a>, but for most climate types these days, the attitude toward pricing is: It would be helpful — and if it turns out to be possible, go for it — but it is neither necessary nor central to comprehensive climate policy.</p>\n<p id=\"UTGNvy\">The environmental justice community is not monolithic, but it is generally opposed to any kind of carbon trading or revenue-neutral carbon taxes. EJ advocates want polluting facilities shut down, not buying credits, and they want public investment in their communities. This was illustrated in Washington state, when environmental justice groups notably failed to rally around a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/10/18/13012394/i-732-carbon-tax-washington\">revenue-neutral carbon tax ballot initiative in 2016</a> but were core supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/28/17899804/washington-1631-results-carbon-fee-green-new-deal\">ballot initiative two years later</a> with a tax that would have distributed most revenue to vulnerable communities. (Both measures lost.)</p>\n<p id=\"ITVgE1\">It is possible to design a carbon pricing system that addresses these concerns, but the price will be there as a backstop supporting other policies (<a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3911\">as it is in California</a>), not as the primary policy instrument.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6y7fVt\">Nuclear power</h3>\n<p id=\"MzwuKJ\">Nuclear power has long been an incredibly divisive issue in the left coalition. Lately, it has become marginally less so, as it becomes clear that there isn’t as much concrete policy disagreement as the heat of the conversation would indicate.</p>\n<aside id=\"YrrKsx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"A beginner’s guide to the debate over nuclear power and climate change\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/6/20852313/december-democratic-debate-nuclear-power-energy\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"sJuBvI\">There is a widespread softening of opinion toward existing nuclear plants, which are increasingly seen as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/5/17196676/nuclear-power-plants-climate-change-renewables\">valuable carbon-free energy</a>. Even the broad array of groups involved in the Vision for Equitable Climate Action agreed that those plants should be kept open until they can be replaced with renewable energy. (Today, nuclear plants that shut down are replaced mostly with natural gas.)</p>\n<p id=\"JfH0KN\">Even most nuclear enthusiasts have come to see that building more of the current generation of nuclear plants would be an expensive disaster, as Vogtle in Georgia is so <a href=\"https://cleanenergy.org/blog/is-there-more-trouble-ahead-for-plant-vogtle-expansion-experts-testify-that-serious-challenges-remain/\">theatrically demonstrating</a>. That’s why no one will finance them.</p>\n<p id=\"R6ZmQV\">Most people across factions agree that R&amp;D into new forms of advanced energy, including modular, low-waste, meltdown-proof nuclear reactors, should be substantially increased.</p>\n<p id=\"UO8Svx\">So ... what is the policy debate about, exactly? It doesn’t seem like the stakes justify the intense feelings.</p>\n<div id=\"A2109X\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Last night during the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NY14?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NY14</a> debate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AOC</a> made it clear that the door is open for nuclear energy in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreenNewDeal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GreenNewDeal</a>   <br>\"The GND leaves the door open for nuclear,\" but community input &amp; vetting new technologies is key. 1/ <a href=\"https://t.co/6Lhi8MxNdO\">pic.twitter.com/6Lhi8MxNdO</a></p>— Third Way Climate &amp; Energy (@ThirdWayEnergy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThirdWayEnergy/status/1262803166053183488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 19, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"wnfdG7\">Nonetheless, the environmental justice community is concerned about the local pollution problems around nuclear plants and uranium mines, and industrial unions are protective of jobs in the nuclear supply chain, so this remains a possible source of discord.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onYEId\">Carbon capture, use, and sequestration</h3>\n<p id=\"91YA0Y\">This one is sticky. Carbon capture serves as an entrée to climate policy for many Republicans and conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin. If there’s any chance for bipartisan climate policy, it probably <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/4/12/15269628/carbon-capture-trump\">starts with carbon capture, use, and sequestration</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"GdNJrP\">But it is problematic on the left, especially in the environmental justice community, for much the same reason as carbon trading. The fear is that allowing dirty power plants and industrial facilities to profit by capturing and selling carbon will allow them to stay open longer, with front-line communities suffering from the air pollution. They want the facilities that are poisoning their communities shut down, not monetized.</p>\n<p id=\"mPNe26\">It’s a sensitive subject. In the Vision for Equitable Climate Action, the 100-plus groups involved managed to agree to support <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/14/17445622/direct-air-capture-air-to-fuels-carbon-dioxide-engineering\">direct air capture</a> of carbon — the kind of carbon capture that’s not attached to other industrial facilities — but that’s about as far as they are willing to go for now.</p>\n<p id=\"95JIWw\">It creates another tension with industrial unions, which stand to benefit from the jobs building carbon capture projects and CO2 pipelines, and with Democratic moderates who are beholden to those unions. And it’s going to create a long-term tension with carbon wonks, who increasingly agree that, like it or not, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/24/18001538/climate-change-co2-removal-negative-emissions-cdr-carbon-dioxide\">gigatons of carbon need to be pulled from the atmosphere</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"1VbXuf\">This, too, could probably be worked out with sufficient good faith on all sides, but in the grinder of politics, it is certain to create some friction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"f9KHTZ\">Climate unity is at hand, if Democrats can grasp it</h3>\n<p id=\"O8JbIF\">There are plenty of climate policies that don’t appear on either of my lists: regenerative agriculture, adaptation and resilience, international climate justice, decarbonization for heavy industry, and much more. They deserve consideration in comprehensive climate policy. This is not meant to be a comprehensive accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"yfNZoa\">The point is simply that, through many different paths, the factions of the left-of-center coalition have aligned around a fairly robust climate policy platform centered on standards, investments, and justice. They have done so through an inclusive process that has helped build trust and capacity across longstanding lines of division. And the issues that remain outstanding are difficult but not intractable, given a little solidarity. They needn’t stand in the way of progress.</p>\n<p id=\"gKVfoB\">It’s not an alignment many people saw coming. “This is a literally unprecedented group of people to work together,” Prakash said. The fact that such diverse participants have agreed on a set of policies, she said, “is mind-blowing.”</p>\n<p id=\"oV6lA0\">What began as an aspirational vision has become a full-fledged, crowdsourced policy platform — the “Green New Details,” as Thomas joked — and it is ready for the national stage. </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgEsw8PGmVSKQ2PIFMsH5bKRlXY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003694/GettyImages_1215149235.jpg\">\n      <cite>Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden might adopt a climate platform strong enough to bring Democrats together.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"yNgAzP\">It remains to be seen whether this nascent alliance can hold together under the inevitable political rigors of the coming years.

      "contentSnippet": "Zac Freland/Vox; Getty Images\n\n\n  The factions of the Democratic coalition have come into alignment on climate change.  Update, July 9: The Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force on climate change issued its policy recommendations on Wednesday, and they are largely in line with the recommendations of the House Special Committee on the Climate Crisis, which are in turn largely in line with the recommendations of various climate advocacy groups. In short, the broad US left-of-center coalition appears to be aligning around a common climate policy vision. That vision is described in the following piece, first published on May 27.\n\nAfter the ignominious failure of the Democratic climate change bill in President Barack Obama’s first term — the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill that narrowly passed the House but never came to a vote in the Senate — what little unity there was on climate change within the Democratic coalition fractured. Everyone went their own way, furious at everyone else. \nDemocratic members of the House were angry at Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was angry at the climate movement, which was angry at the big mainstream green groups, which were angry at Obama, who was reduced to addressing climate change through regulations that President Donald Trump wound up repealing. \nIn all, the decade of climate politics from 2008 to 2018 netted frustratingly little progress at the federal level or consensus about the path ahead. No one was happy, and no one agreed on what to do next. Robinson Meyer captured it well in a 2017 piece in the Atlantic: “Democrats Are Shockingly Unprepared to Fight Climate Change.”\nBut something different has been happening lately, as groups across the left come together to hash out their differences on climate policy. It turns out they agree on quite a bit. In fact, for the first time in memory, there’s a broad alignment forming around a climate policy platform that is both ambitious enough to address the problem and politically potent enough to unite all the left’s various interest groups.\nWith the coronavirus raging and the economy facing a bleak near-term future, there is more appetite than ever for something big, a vision of a better post-virus economy and society. And such a vision is taking shape on the left.\nIf presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were smart, he would embrace this vision, serve as its champion, and make a serious bid to unite the left behind him. And there are signs that he will try to do just that. It’s still a long shot, but there’s at least a chance that Democrats could go into the 2020 election with their act together on climate change. And who saw that coming? \nIn this post, I’ll offer an account of the new climate alignment: how it came to be, what kinds of climate policies it contains, what it leaves out, and its prospects moving forward. In the next post, I cover Biden’s climate strategy.\nThe coming together of the climate left\nAfter a decade of dissolution, work on climate policy development cranked back up in earnest around 2018. States where Democrats took control passed climate and clean energy bills. Every Democratic candidate for president produced ambitious climate plans. “All of those people who ran for president, who are currently sitting electeds, had a much more expanded vision on climate by the end of their campaigns than when they started,” said Maggie Thomas, who served as deputy climate director of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s campaign and then policy advisor to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign.\n  \n        \n      Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n      Gov. Jay Inslee met with solar workers while campaigning for president in San Francisco, California, in May 2019.\n  \nDemocrats in both the House and Senate drafted climate bills (the CLEAN Future Act and the Clean Economy Act, respectively), and the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which has been holding hearings all year, is expected to release its recommendations this summer. \nPerhaps most notably, behind the scenes, nonprofits on the left began a flurry of climate policy conclaves and discussions — often across factional lines, involving mainstream groups, left groups, environmental justice groups, and unions — to try to determine where there was consensus and where disagreements remained.\nA few of these groups and efforts are worth mentioning. There was the Green New Deal, which burst onto the scene in November 2018 and utterly transformed the climate discussion, though it was a bit light on concrete policy. The US Climate Action Network convened a policy process that ended up involving more than 175 people from at least 106 separate groups across the climate-concerned spectrum; this May, it produced the surprisingly substantial Vision for Equitable Climate Action. \nThe BlueGreen Alliance, a group that brings together environmentalists and labor, developed “Solidarity for Climate Action,” the first serious climate platform to get a sign-off from United Steelworkers. The Equitable & Just National Climate Platform was developed by a long list of environmental justice groups alongside some bigger players like the League of Conservation Voters. Finally, in April, the brain trust behind Inslee’s gold-standard climate campaign plan spun up a group called Evergreen Action to advocate for it. \nOver the past few weeks, I have talked to more than a dozen people involved in this extraordinary burst of policy discussion and development. Just about every one of them made a point of commenting on the degree of comity and good faith shown thus far, even across some traditionally tense factional lines. \n“Having groups all work together on a national climate policy platform — people from different regions, environmental stressors, gender identities, races — really did help to build alignment and trust,” Lindsay Harper, executive director of the environmental justice group Georgia WAND and co-chair of the US Climate Action Network process, told me. \nBecause policy development did not begin within a legislative process, it was not bound from the outset by compromise. Thanks in part to the Green New Deal, it began in imagination and aspiration. And it uncovered more and deeper agreement on climate policy than anyone might have predicted a few years ago. Though plenty of issues remain to be addressed, the broad left-of-center appears aligned around rapid decarbonization through stringent sector-specific standards, large-scale public investments, and a commitment to justice (“SIJ,” in my unwieldy acronym).\n“After more than 20 years of working in and with the progressive movement, I’m more cynical than most about prospects for unity on the left,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance. “But I’m increasingly hopeful that we can unify the movement’s factions, and all Democrats, around a policy agenda that frames climate action as industrial policy geared toward rebuilding America’s infrastructure and manufacturing base, with justice and equity baked in rather than an optional ingredient.”\nBefore getting into SIJ’s constitutive parts, it is worth discussing a few of the principles that have guided its development.\nNet-zero emissions by 2050 is the new baseline\nThe first has to do with the explosive impact of the 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That report examined the difference in impact between a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures and a 2°C rise. Spoiler: It is huge and disastrous. The IPCC concluded that to limit temperatures to 1.5°C would require the entire world to reach net-zero carbon emissions, emitting no more than it is absorbing, by midcentury. (It also concluded that most countries are far off track.)\nThat goal — net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — has become table stakes, the new baseline for US climate policy. Virtually every candidate and climate platform mentioned above endorses it. Democrats in both houses of Congress endorse it. Even the American Conservation Coalition, a politically conservative group of young people concerned about climate change, endorses it. Now net zero by 2050 is what it means to “address climate change.” \nThat is an enormous change in climate politics, inconceivable even a few years ago.\n\n  \n        \n      NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      The Extinction Rebellion movement led a direct action protest in London in February 2020.\n  \n\n  \n        \n      David Cliff/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      Several such coordinated global protests are set to continue throughout 2020.\n  \n\n\nSome groups, like the Extinction Rebellion protesters who have led civil disobedience actions in cities around the world, argue that wealthy countries like the UK and the US should decarbonize by 2030 to allow more time for developing countries to catch up. Initially, some left groups in the US, including the youth-oriented Sunrise Movement, argued the same thing. But that demand more or less faded into the background as it became clear that very few groups or candidates, if any, would endorse it.\nThough some activists might still wish for an earlier target, net zero by 2050 is incredibly ambitious. It will require a large-scale, rapid transition, driven by policy. Many of the people and groups endorsing it do not seem to fully comprehend this yet, but if you work backward from net zero by 2050, you arrive at policy radicalism. There’s no avoiding it.\nRepublicans aren’t going to help\nThe second principle is that Republicans aren’t going to help. There are still some centrist groups that pursue bipartisan cooperation on climate, and groups of (retired, young, or otherwise not in power) conservatives that will talk to them. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump have convinced the vast majority of people on the left that there is simply nothing to be gained by pursuing Republican cooperation. For the foreseeable future, Democrats will achieve on climate change whatever they can achieve on their own, however little it may prove to be. Wishing it were otherwise doesn’t make today’s GOP any less dysfunctional, irrational, and corrupt. \nBecause there is no help coming from the right and the left must do the job on its own, the political strategy becomes about uniting the left — getting as many of the left’s constituent interest groups as possible on board — to maximize the ambition and freedom to act of Democratic politicians. \n  \n        \n      Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n      From left, Sen. Roy Blunt, President Trump, Sen. John Barrasso, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, following the weekly Republican Senate policy luncheon on May 19.\n  \nIt is not Republicans’ willingness to act that should set the limit on climate policy aspirations. “We’re not really fighting against another party,” said Thomas, who is now political director at Evergreen. “We have to respond to science.”\nCarbon pricing has been dethroned\nThe third principle, which falls out of the first two, is that carbon pricing — long treated as the sine qua non of serious climate policy — is no longer at the center of these discussions, or even particularly privileged in them. For one thing, there’s the political economy: Raising prices is unpopular, and raising prices enough, fast enough, to hit the 2050 target will be an almost insuperable political challenge. Cap and trade is still in the reputational toilet. Carbon taxes never saw the bipartisan support their backers always promised. The politics of carbon pricing just don’t seem to be going anywhere.\n“The debate about whether a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax is the right solution for this crisis has completely gone out the window,” said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement.\n  \n        \n      Andrew Harnik/AP\n      Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash at a climate rally in January 2020. \n  \nThere is still room for pricing in climate policy (if environmental justice concerns are taken into account), but the dream of having one simple plan that solves the climate problem is, at least on the left, dead. It is now clear, if only from the experience of states that have actually passed legislation, that something more pragmatic and targeted, something more like industrial policy, is needed.\nSo with those principles in mind, let’s look at the three pillars of the new SIJ alignment.\nStandards: Electricity, cars, and buildings\nAn economy the size of America’s is unlikely to fully decarbonize by 2030. There are sectors of the economy (think heavy industry) where clean alternatives are not yet fully developed and economically competitive. It will take some time to work them out. \nBut it is vitally important that the US make rapid progress in those sectors where clean alternatives are available and just need to be scaled up. Primarily, that means electricity, cars, and buildings.\nTogether, those sectors make up close to two-thirds of US emissions. The core of any aggressive 10-year mobilization on climate must be to target them, not sideways through a carbon price, but directly, through sector-specific performance standards and incentives, to drive out the carbon as quickly as possible.\nThough the details differ, this basic electricity-cars-buildings approach can be found in recent legislation from states like Colorado, Washington, and California. It was the part of Inslee’s climate plan (by 2030, a net-zero electricity sector, no new fossil fuel cars sold, and no new fossil-fueled buildings built) that Warren subsequently adopted as her own. Sanders had his own, characteristically turbocharged version. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg had a version that achieved aggressive targets in those sectors entirely through executive action.\nThe same standards-based approach was at the heart of the Green New Deal and has found a place in virtually every green group climate platform and both the House Democrats’ CLEAN Future Act and the Senate Democrats’ Clean Economy Act.\nThe policies are not identical. In electricity, Evergreen calls for a clean energy standard (CES) to hit net zero by 2030. Bloomberg promised 80 percent emission reductions in the sector using only strengthened EPA authorities, including a souped-up version of Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The Vision for Equitable Climate Action endorses 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 (rather than net-zero carbon, the more permissive standard that most states have adopted). The CLEAN Act also proposed a CES, but it targets carbon neutrality in the sector by 2050 and includes a credit-trading scheme. \nThere is similar variety in policy on cars and buildings. The Evergreen platform would crank up fuel economy standards to ensure that all new vehicles sold in the US are zero-emission by 2030. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed a plan to make all vehicles on US roads clean by 2040, combining trade-in incentives and grants for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Recommendations on buildings range from updating codes to decarbonizing all federally owned properties to launching a massive national energy-retrofit program.\n  \n        \n      RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n      Denver’s popular electric buses produce no local air pollution.\n  \nThe details vary, but there is a strong common core: performance standards and incentives for the three biggest emitting sectors, aimed at making rapid, substantial progress on emissions in the next 10 years. The ultimate vision is a carbon-free electricity sector powering an electrified, emission-free vehicle fleet and building stock.\n“We know from state-level action that clean energy standards are driving the most significant and sustained emissions reductions,” Thomas said. “So let’s scale that up, apply it nationally.” \nInvestment: We can have nice things\nOne idea that the Green New Deal revitalized on the left is large-scale public investment. That idea is not new, but something about the moment — the rising danger of climate change, the growing influence of Sanders-style democratic socialism, the pent-up public need after decades of austerity politics — made it resonate. \nThe former Democratic presidential candidates got the message. Sanders put forward the largest bid: $16.3 trillion in public investments over 10 years. Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro came in at $10 trillion, Jay Inslee at $9 trillion, Cory Booker at $3 trillion, Amy Klobuchar between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, and Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg at around $2 trillion. (With the exception of Sanders, most of those numbers represent not only public money but also private investment pulled forward by public spending.)\nPublic investment plays a huge role in the BlueGreen Alliance platform and the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform. Oregon Rep. Peter DiFazio is still pushing his $760 billion infrastructure bill and there are substantial infrastructure investments in the Clean Economy Act. \nA wide range of investments are recommended by these platforms, everything from a national green bank (Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Chris Murphy have sponsored a bill to create one) to rural electrification, universal broadband, long-distance electricity transmission, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. \nThe investment ideas cover a wide range, but the focus in all of them is supporting green industries, manufacturing, and research, and, above all, creating jobs. \nAnd not just any jobs: well-paying, high-quality jobs. Which brings us to our third category.\nJustice: For unions, fossil fuel workers, and front-line communities\nUnions, hard-hit fossil fuel communities, and vulnerable front-line communities have not always been prioritized in climate policy discussions, but this time around, in a break with past practice, they have been at the table from the beginning, helping to shape the policy platform.\nIn part, this reflects a moral imperative — past transitions in the economy have tended to come at the expense of workers and vulnerable communities. But it also reflects a political imperative. Remember, the strategy here is to unite the left, pulling together a coalition that extends beyond traditional environmental groups and demographics. To do that, climate advocates will need both the environmental justice movement (one of the left’s fastest rising forces) and unions (one of the left’s most powerful existing forces) on board.\n  \n        \n      Mead Gruver/AP\n      Wyoming Mining Association executive director Travis Deti, pictured working from his home in Cheyenne on April 13, has been calling for help for the coal industry in the form of lower federal royalties and other aid due to the decreased demand for coal during the coronavirus crisis.\n  \nThat won’t be easy. Those groups have demands of climate policy that are not always commensurate, and relations between them — and between each of them and the climate movement — are still somewhat tentative and fragile. \nNonetheless, putting justice first represents the most notable shift in green thinking and strategy over the past decade, and it has uncovered a few elements that draw broad support.\n1. Unions\nLast year, Washington state passed a 100 percent clean energy bill that offered tax incentives to clean energy projects, but it made the incentives contingent on project labor standards. Projects paying prevailing wages could get 75 percent of the value of the incentives; to get 100 percent, they had to sign a “community workforce agreement or project labor agreement,” agreeing to a package of wages and benefits.\n“Washington’s 100 percent clean law is just five months old and is already leading several developers to opt for union workers, including a 144 MW wind farm and others in development,” said Vlad Gutman, Washington director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions. “The renewable industry isn’t new here, but these will be some of the first projects built by unions. We’re happy to see the law working as intended.”\nClimate advocates want to take such ideas to the national level. Evergreen’s climate plan proposes to “reunionize and empower workers in every industry with new tools to collectively bargain.” It would repeal “right to work” laws, amend the National Labor Relations Act to make it easier to unionize, step up enforcement of labor laws, raise the minimum wage, modernize overtime laws, and much more. Virtually every Democratic candidate stressed the creation of “union-friendly jobs.” \nThe BlueGreen Alliance recommends the “application of strong Buy American and Davis-Bacon requirements, as well as utilization of project labor agreements, for all public spending, and procurement policies that ensure the use of domestic, clean, and safe materials made by law-abiding corporations throughout the supply chain.”\nThe Vision for Equitable Climate Action recommends policies that require any jobs created by public investments to “abide by high-road labor standards, with unions, frontline communities, and other impacted local populations taking the lead on developing these policies, such as prevailing wages, strict safety standards, and project labor agreements with unions.” The Equitable and Just National Climate Platform stresses “high-quality jobs with family-sustaining wages and safe and healthy working conditions.” \nOne of the reasons unions have traditionally been suspicious of climate campaigners is that, despite all the flowery talk about a “just transition,” in reality, the jobs being created by the clean energy economy pay less and are less likely to be unionized. Across the left, there is a shared recognition that public policy should aim to change that.\n2. Fossil fuel communities\nSimilarly, communities dependent on fossil fuel jobs do not yet believe they will find equal or better livelihoods in a clean energy economy. They, too, have heard a lot of pretty talk, but the reality, from Appalachia to the shale fields of North Dakota to the coal mines of Wyoming, is that the loss of fossil fuel jobs tends to leave behind economic wreckage.\nDemocrats have been at least fitfully trying to help. Obama had a comprehensive plan to help these communities, but the Republican Senate didn’t pass it. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 platform included a $30 billion aid package to impacted coal communities.\nBut putting emissions first and adding something for workers as an afterthought “is just the wrong order of operations,” Prakash said. “I think people are starting to get that. We’re seeing people foreground equity and frontload a plan for worker transition.”\nEvergreen’s plan, for instance, contains a “G.I. Bill for impacted fossil fuel workers and communities” that would guarantee the retirement, pension, and health care benefits of all affected fossil fuel workers and provide them with ongoing income support and retraining opportunities. That’s the scale of intervention necessary to truly keep fossil fuel workers whole. And it’s probably much less expensive, economically and politically, than forever trying to overcome the opposition of fossil fuel communities.\nSimilar prioritization of worker transition can be found across climate platforms on the left. It is not an afterthought anymore.\n3. Front-line communities\nThe idea of environmental justice grows out of the simple fact that virtually every environmental harm disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable communities: low-income communities, communities of color, indigenous communities, and so on. They are more likely to live next to roads and industrial facilities; breathe the most pollution, indoors and out; suffer most from industrial waste; depend most on public transit ... the list goes on.\nEnvironmental justice has been around on the periphery of the green movement for years, struggling to get real recognition and resources. But again, something about the moment, particularly the impact of the Green New Deal and the strength of the resurgent left, has vaulted it to the center. Rather than doing something for or about environmental justice communities, greens are making policy with them, around the same table. As Harper told me, “if you are down with equity, you’ve got to give us space.”\nThe best example of this is the Equitable & Just National Climate Platform, which pulled together big national green groups and environmental justice groups. “It has been a good process, a just process,” said Michele Roberts of Environmental Justice Health Alliance, which was involved in the work. “It’s been a very intentional building of relationships, a very intentional dive into everything from policies to the alignment of resources.” \nThat platform is the place to go to see the full range of environmental justice concerns and recommendations, from clean air and water to access to affordable energy to wealth-building and anti-displacement efforts. \n\n  \n        \n      Karla Ann Cote/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      Protesters marched in Newark, New Jersey, on August 26, 2019, to bring attention to the water crisis gripping the city.\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Karla Ann Cote/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      Areas in Newark have had drinking water lead levels higher than in Flint, Michigan.\n  \n\n\nEvery Democratic candidate addressed the issue; Warren had what was probably the most detailed plan. The House’s CLEAN Future Act has an entire title (VI) devoted to environmental justice, and the Senate’s Clean Economy Act was written, according to its authors, to “address the cumulative environmental effects in economically distressed communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities.”\n“Our climate action plan will prioritize investment where it is most needed,” said Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, the chair of the Select Committee, “including rural and deindustrialized areas, low-income communities, and communities of color.”\nOnce again, the policy details differ. Some common recommendations include better “equity mapping” to identify vulnerable communities, an “equity screen” on all public investments to ensure that they go first to vulnerable communities, and high-level environmental justice committees in the White House, EPA, and/or DOJ.\nThese measures will build on work already happening in the Democratic caucus. “You see other pieces happening on Capitol Hill such as the Environmental Justice for All Act with Congressman [Raúl] Grijalva,” Roberts said. “And you see momentum in the work of Sen. Booker, Sen. [Tammy] Duckworth, and others. You see huge momentum in congressional staff members wanting to actually engage to make sure that there’s justice language in all these pieces.”\nA common vision, not a compromise\nSo that’s the alignment, at least at a high level. “It was the culmination of all the candidates trying to outdo one another,” said Thomas. “Now the best of those ideas are out there and the party is coalescing.”\n“Standards, investment, and justice,” she said, “are the future of federal climate policy.”\nSIJ is not quite as compact or easy to explain as a carbon tax. One of the consequences of giving up on carbon pricing as a silver bullet is that you end up with silver buckshot — lots of smaller policies that add up to sufficiency. \nThe disaggregated nature of the policy has substantial political benefits, though. It was never easy to explain to industries or individuals how they would be affected by a complicated, indirect system of carbon credits, trading, and offsets — ask anyone involved in the 2009 Waxman-Markey fight. Because it is more sector-specific and investment-focused, the effects and benefits of SIJ for particular constituencies are easier to trace and explain.\nIt is likely to be more resilient than a single national program as well. The breadth of the SIJ approach is meant to infuse climate as a focus throughout the government, not just in one agency or policy, so that if any individual part of it is blocked or rolled back, all is not lost. \nAnd finally, whereas cap and trade or any other one-ring-to-rule-them-all climate policy must be passed in Congress, where Republican use of the Senate filibuster continues to make everything impossible, a great deal of SIJ policy can be accomplished in other ways. Much of the standards and justice pieces could be done through the executive powers of the president and federal agencies. \nAnd the investment piece could be tackled in a stimulus bill (assuming Republicans allow a Democratic president to pass a stimulus bill) or — because it’s purely about spending and not about standards or regulatory changes — through a process called budget reconciliation, which requires only a bare majority in the Senate. \nIn other words, there’s a great deal in the SIJ framework for which a president can be held accountable, even with an uncooperative Congress. \n“Standards, investment, and justice are the future of federal climate policy”\nBest of all, the SIJ framework emerged organically, from the ground up. “Through our stakeholder outreach and hearings,” said Castor, “we’ve found broad consensus for a climate plan that’s centered on building and rebuilding America’s infrastructure and creating a new generation of secure, middle-class jobs, all while enacting commonsense policies that support a clean energy economy and reinvigorate American manufacturing.”\nThe SIJ platform is robust and would constitute an ambitious climate program on its own. However, it doesn’t contain everything. There are still significant issues that don’t command full agreement across the left, that remain to be worked out.\nI will list some of those outstanding issues, from closest to consensus to furthest. To be clear: I’m not arguing that the items on this list are bad policies or even bad politics. They may still find a place in comprehensive federal climate policy. But there are intra-left conflicts around them that remain to be resolved.\nAccountability for fossil fuel companies\nThis one is extremely popular across the left. Every Democratic candidate supports it, along with almost every nonprofit climate platform. \nThe idea is that fossil fuel companies have known for a long time that their products are harming public health and have done everything in their power to cover it up, including funneling untold amounts of money into the political system and running some extremely deceptive public campaigns. Still, today, they are heavily subsidized and financed by public and private institutions that ignore their growing risks.\nThere are three policy avenues that fall under the broad rubric of accountability.\n  \n        \n      Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images\n      President Trump holds a roundtable meeting with energy sector CEOs in the Cabinet Room of the White House on April 3, 2020.\n  \nThe first is supporting the growing number of lawsuits against fossil fuel companies. Sen. Kamala Harris especially emphasized this in her plan, playing on her history as a prosecutor, as did Sanders, playing on his history as an anti-corporate crusader, but virtually all the Democratic candidates (including Biden) agreed.\nThe second is taking steps to reform the financial system to force financial institutions to better account for the growing risks of fossil fuels in their investment decisions. (This post has the policy details.) \nThe third is ending fossil fuel subsidies, something practically everyone says they want to do, and has said they want to do for decades, but never manages to actually do. (See this post for more on the breadth of those subsidies.) \nThe only reason I didn’t include accountability in the alignment above is that direct confrontation with fossil fuel companies still makes some quarters of the left uncomfortable, especially more conservative Democrats and some parts of labor.\nSpeaking of which ...\nKeep it in the ground\nSupply-side climate efforts — attempting to directly restrict the mining, drilling, and transportation of fossil fuels — exploded in popularity in the wake of the 2010 Waxman-Markey failure and have been a key organizing axis for the climate movement ever since, helping it ally with affected communities and grow its grassroots reach.\nSuch efforts have won the grudging respect of some wonks and the support of more left-leaning Democrats, including Sanders, Warren, Inslee, Steyer, and even Bloomberg. (Honest, he is left-leaning on climate!)\nBiden has sent mixed rhetorical signals about supply-side policy, but his platform includes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” and “modifying royalties to account for climate costs,” two key requests of supply-siders.\nIt is not always clear what the policy stakes of this debate are. Activists have pushed for a national ban on fracking, but that’s not something a president can do (most fracking is on private land) and it’s not something any Congress will do. The president can control fossil fuel projects on public land, but most available policy tools go after supply indirectly by reducing demand.\nIt’s clear that some kind of supply-side effort is a shared priority across the left and is likely to be part of the Democratic platform. The limiting, or at least complicating, factor is unions, specifically the old-line industrial unions, the steelworkers and pipe fitters who make good money working on drilling rigs and pipeline projects and don’t want to see them blocked or canceled.\nThey do not constitute a majority of unionized workers. The service sector unions — the health care workers, teachers, and public service employees — are larger and growing the fastest, and they are generally more climate-friendly. But the old-line unions have disproportionate political influence and command the loyalty, or at least fear, of many Democrats.\nCarbon pricing\nMost Democratic candidates and Democrats in Congress still include some kind of price on carbon in their plans, including Sanders and Inslee. There are still people fixated on a carbon price as the One True Climate Policy, and parts of the climate left that have turned on it completely, but for most climate types these days, the attitude toward pricing is: It would be helpful — and if it turns out to be possible, go for it — but it is neither necessary nor central to comprehensive climate policy.\nThe environmental justice community is not monolithic, but it is generally opposed to any kind of carbon trading or revenue-neutral carbon taxes. EJ advocates want polluting facilities shut down, not buying credits, and they want public investment in their communities. This was illustrated in Washington state, when environmental justice groups notably failed to rally around a revenue-neutral carbon tax ballot initiative in 2016 but were core supporters of a ballot initiative two years later with a tax that would have distributed most revenue to vulnerable communities. (Both measures lost.)\nIt is possible to design a carbon pricing system that addresses these concerns, but the price will be there as a backstop supporting other policies (as it is in California), not as the primary policy instrument.\nNuclear power\nNuclear power has long been an incredibly divisive issue in the left coalition. Lately, it has become marginally less so, as it becomes clear that there isn’t as much concrete policy disagreement as the heat of the conversation would indicate.\nThere is a widespread softening of opinion toward existing nuclear plants, which are increasingly seen as valuable carbon-free energy. Even the broad array of groups involved in the Vision for Equitable Climate Action agreed that those plants should be kept open until they can be replaced with renewable energy. (Today, nuclear plants that shut down are replaced mostly with natural gas.)\nEven most nuclear enthusiasts have come to see that building more of the current generation of nuclear plants would be an expensive disaster, as Vogtle in Georgia is so theatrically demonstrating. That’s why no one will finance them.\nMost people across factions agree that R&D into new forms of advanced energy, including modular, low-waste, meltdown-proof nuclear reactors, should be substantially increased.\nSo ... what is the policy debate about, exactly? It doesn’t seem like the stakes justify the intense feelings.\n\n\nLast night during the #NY14 debate, @AOC made it clear that the door is open for nuclear energy in the #GreenNewDeal   \"The GND leaves the door open for nuclear,\" but community input & vetting new technologies is key. 1/ pic.twitter.com/6Lhi8MxNdO— Third Way Climate & Energy (@ThirdWayEnergy) May 19, 2020\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the environmental justice community is concerned about the local pollution problems around nuclear plants and uranium mines, and industrial unions are protective of jobs in the nuclear supply chain, so this remains a possible source of discord.\nCarbon capture, use, and sequestration\nThis one is sticky. Carbon capture serves as an entrée to climate policy for many Republicans and conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin. If there’s any chance for bipartisan climate policy, it probably starts with carbon capture, use, and sequestration.\nBut it is problematic on the left, especially in the environmental justice community, for much the same reason as carbon trading. The fear is that allowing dirty power plants and industrial facilities to profit by capturing and selling carbon will allow them to stay open longer, with front-line communities suffering from the air pollution. They want the facilities that are poisoning their communities shut down, not monetized.\nIt’s a sensitive subject. In the Vision for Equitable Climate Action, the 100-plus groups involved managed to agree to support direct air capture of carbon — the kind of carbon capture that’s not attached to other industrial facilities — but that’s about as far as they are willing to go for now.\nIt creates another tension with industrial unions, which stand to benefit from the jobs building carbon capture projects and CO2 pipelines, and with Democratic moderates who are beholden to those unions. And it’s going to create a long-term tension with carbon wonks, who increasingly agree that, like it or not, gigatons of carbon need to be pulled from the atmosphere. \nThis, too, could probably be worked out with sufficient good faith on all sides, but in the grinder of politics, it is certain to create some friction.\nClimate unity is at hand, if Democrats can grasp it\nThere are plenty of climate policies that don’t appear on either of my lists: regenerative agriculture, adaptation and resilience, international climate justice, decarbonization for heavy industry, and much more. They deserve consideration in comprehensive climate policy. This is not meant to be a comprehensive accounting.\nThe point is simply that, through many different paths, the factions of the left-of-center coalition have aligned around a fairly robust climate policy platform centered on standards, investments, and justice. They have done so through an inclusive process that has helped build trust and capacity across longstanding lines of division. And the issues that remain outstanding are difficult but not intractable, given a little solidarity. They needn’t stand in the way of progress.\nIt’s not an alignment many people saw coming. “This is a literally unprecedented group of people to work together,” Prakash said. The fact that such diverse participants have agreed on a set of policies, she said, “is mind-blowing.”\nWhat began as an aspirational vision has become a full-fledged, crowdsourced policy platform — the “Green New Details,” as Thomas joked — and it is ready for the national stage. \n  \n        \n      Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n      Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden might adopt a climate platform strong enough to bring Democrats together.\n  \n\nIt remains to be seen whether this nascent alliance can hold together under the inevitable political rigors of the coming years. It will face stresses from within and without the Democratic coalition.\nIn many ways, its fate lies in the hands of a man many in the climate movement have spent the past year bashing: Joe Biden. Does Biden’s campaign have the agility and acumen to embrace the new alignment and serve as its champion? Could Biden, of all people, unify the climate left?\nAs fanciful as that idea may sound, there are, it turns out, reasons for hope. In my next post, I take a closer look at the political road ahead.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated how much electricity, cars, and buildings contribute to US emissions. Those sectors make up close to two-thirds of US emissions.\n\nYour support makes this work possible\nThe climate crisis is one of the defining stories of our time.

Vance</em></a>, largely maintains the status quo. As Chief Justice John Roberts states in the first line of that opinion, “in our judicial system, ‘the public has a right to every man’s evidence,’” and “since the earliest days of the Republic, ‘every man’ has included the President of the United States.” Trump does not enjoy absolute immunity from a state prosecutor’s criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"xFcCQG\">The latter case, however, is a significant shift in the law governing congressional investigations, and an equally significant victory from Trump. The upshot of <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-715_febh.pdf\"><em>Trump v. Mazars</em></a> is that House investigators almost certainly will not see potentially damning records concerning Trump’s finances until after the November election. <em>Mazars</em> was also written by Roberts. </p>\n<p id=\"zwhWzF\">Though <em>Mazars</em> does not preclude the House from seeing those records eventually, by the time those records become available Trump will almost certainly either be an ex-president, or he will be firmly entrenched in his second term.</p>\n<p id=\"JehWKL\">On the surface, it is easy to see <em>Mazars</em> as a defeat for Trump. The decision was 7-2, with all four of the Court’s liberals joining the majority. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both wrote dissents, where they complain that the majority didn’t do enough to protect Trump from investigation. </p>\n<p id=\"OkASky\">But make no mistake, <em>Mazars</em> is a victory for Trump because it holds that the president enjoys special immunity from congressional investigation enjoyed by no other citizen — and because it likely shields Trump’s records from the public eye until after the election.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gYfY75\">What these investigations are about</h3>\n<p id=\"I5S8iw\">Both cases involve subpoenas targeting financial firms that possess some of Trump’s financial records, an apparent effort to obtain records that the president would not turn over voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"mOb16M\"><em>Mazars</em> concerns three different probes seeking these records. The House Oversight Committee <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/10/11/20909811/trump-loss-congressional-oversight-mazars-tatel\">subpoenaed the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA</a>, seeking many of Trump’s financial documents. </p>\n<p id=\"ya8eTP\">As a lower court that upheld this subpoena explained, this investigation began after “the Office of Government Ethics announced that it had identified an error in one of the several reports that President Trump had filed since he became a presidential candidate in 2015.” Later on, Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump “‘inflated his total assets when it served his purposes’ in some situations and had ‘deflated his assets’ in others,” thus exacerbating fears that Trump did not comply with federal ethics laws requiring him to disclose his finances.</p>\n<p id=\"KDBm3O\">Among other things, the House says that this investigation is needed to determine whether stronger ethics laws are necessary to prevent presidents from misrepresenting their finances in the future. </p>\n<p id=\"cWhKSB\">Another probe is being run by the House Financial Services Committee. Among other things, the Financial Services Committee says it is investigating “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-715/134253/20200226162318816_Nos%2019%20715%20760%20%20Merits%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">the influx of illicit money, including from Russian oligarchs</a>,” which “has flowed largely unimpeded into the United States through … anonymous shell companies and into U.S. investments, including luxury high-end real estate.” This investigation touches upon Trump and his businesses because of concerns that Trump is tied to wealthy former Soviet businessmen with <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/03/28/trump-business-past-ties-russian-mobsters-organized-crime/98321252/\">links to money laundering</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"JahL6k\">A third probe by the<strong> </strong>House Intelligence Committee also seeks many of the same documents. Its investigation touches more directly upon Trump himself, as it seeks to answer questions like whether there are “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government, or related foreign actors, and individuals associated with Donald Trump’s campaign, transition, administration, or business interests, in furtherance of the Russian government’s interests.” This investigation could inform legislation seeking to reduce foreign interference in US elections.</p>\n<p id=\"BqBXoH\">Finally, the <em>Vance</em> case involves Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s criminal investigation into the Trump Organization and related businesses. Vance’s <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-635/134172/20200226111950479_19-635%20Brief%20of%20Respondent.pdf\">brief to the Supreme Court</a> points to “multiple public reports” describing “transactions and tax strategies ... spanning more than a decade,” which suggested that Trump’s businesses were engaged in criminal activity within Vance’s jurisdiction. Vance points specifically to “‘hush money’ payments made on behalf of [Trump] to two women with whom [Trump] allegedly had extra-marital affairs.” </p>\n<p id=\"tqdqF4\">Vance’s office subpoenaed Mazars, seeking many of the same documents sought by the House.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Eifc2z\">Under existing law, Trump should have lost both cases</h3>\n<p id=\"Br3yPP\">The Court’s <em>Vance</em> opinion places heavy emphasis on the fact that existing law does not immunize Trump from criminal investigation. Trump, for example, argued that subjecting him to such an investigation is impermissible because it could distract him from his official duties. “But that argument runs up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that Presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process even when the President is under investigation,” according to Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"OYMhfR\">Similarly, Roberts rejects Trump’s claim that “subjecting Presidents to state criminal subpoenas will make them ‘easily identifiable target[s]’ for harassment.” As <em>Vance</em> notes, “we rejected a nearly identical argument in [<em>Clinton v. Jones </em>(1997)], where then-President Clinton argued that permitting civil liability for unofficial acts would ‘generate a large volume of politically motivated harassing and frivolous litigation.’”</p>\n<p id=\"ZB9uFO\">Though Vance’s office may continue its probe into Trump, the <em>Vance</em> decision does not mean that this probe will not face additional obstacles. As Roberts notes, Trump still has the “right to challenge the subpoena on any grounds permitted by state law, which usually include bad faith and undue burden or breadth.” The subpoena could also be invalidated if a court concluded that it was “an attempt to influence the performance of [Trump’s] official duties,” or if Trump could show that the subpoenas would “significantly interfere with his efforts to carry out” those duties.</p>\n<p id=\"rMw57A\"><em>Vance</em> simply means that Trump does not enjoy total immunity from state criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"orPbO5\">But if <em>Vance</em> was a blow to Trump’s attempts to avoid Vance’s investigation, <em>Mazars</em> was a blow to the House’s three probes into Trump.</p>\n<p id=\"Y4H6Mg\">Prior to <em>Mazars</em>, the law governing the House’s power to conduct investigations was, if anything, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/5/21232869/supreme-court-mazars-vance-deutsche-bank-trump-subpoenas-immunity-nixon\">even less favorable to Trump’s arguments</a> than the law governing the <em>Vance</em> case. As the Supreme Court held in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/421/491/\"><em>Eastland v. United States Servicemen’s Fund</em></a> (1975), “the power to investigate and to do so through compulsory process ... is inherent in the power to make laws” because without such a power, “a legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.”</p>\n<p id=\"aVLCYK\"><em>Eastland </em>held that Congress is entitled to gather information — and to use compulsory subpoenas to gather such information — whenever that subpoena is “intended to gather information about a subject on which legislation may be had.” So long as the congressional subpoenas sought information on a topic that could plausibly be subject to an act of Congress, those subpoenas were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"RlsZ0r\">The new rule announced in <em>Mazars</em>, however, can be boiled down into four words: “the president is special.”</p>\n<p id=\"RzetkP\">According to Roberts, “congressional subpoenas for the President’s information unavoidably pit the political branches against one another.” He adds that “without limits on its subpoena powers, Congress could ‘exert an imperious controul’ [sic] over the Executive Branch and aggrandize itself at the President’s expense, just as the Framers feared.”</p>\n<p id=\"g0FgoR\">So <em>Mazars </em>invents new limits on congressional subpoenas targeting the president, and sends the case back down to a lower court to apply this new rule. </p>\n<h3 id=\"QSk3yW\">The new rules impose strict limits on congressional investigations targeting the president</h3>\n<p id=\"hysmBS\">Roberts’s <em>Mazars</em> decision lists several new limits on any congressional investigation into the president. </p>\n<p id=\"P32czc\">Among other things, courts must “carefully assess whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants the significant step of involving the President and his papers.” They must “insist on a subpoena no broader than reasonably necessary to support Congress’s legislative objective.” They must be particularly reluctant to allow investigations when “Congress contemplates legislation that raises sensitive constitutional issues, such as legislation concerning the Presidency.” And they “should be careful to assess the burdens imposed on the President by a subpoena.” </p>\n<p id=\"6KoppF\">It’s not immediately clear why the Court voted so overwhelmingly to create the new rules governing investigations into the president. One possible explanation is that Douglas Letter, the lawyer for the House, delivered an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/12/21255811/house-trump-supreme-court-mazars-deutsche-bank-vance\">utterly disastrous performance at oral argument</a> — he was repeatedly unable to answer obvious questions from the justices, such as what might be reasonable limits on congressional subpoenas, if the Court were to impose such limits.</p>\n<p id=\"4KNAlR\">Another possible explanation is that the Court’s liberals simply lacked the votes to order the House subpoenas enforced, so they decided that it was better to cast their lot with Roberts than to risk having their conservative colleagues unite behind a rule that was even more favorable to Trump. </p>\n<p id=\"t6cQyg\">The liberal justices may also have been concerned about too-aggressive probes into a potential Biden administration — although, as the holding in <em>Mazars </em>specifically concerns the president, a Republican-controlled Congress could still investigate Biden White House officials or members of his Cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"m5GiYS\">In any event, it’s also not immediately clear how the new rules will apply to each of the three congressional investigations, and that lack of clarity is why <em>Mazars</em> is such an important victory for Trump. This case will now be reheard by a trial court, which will have to conduct its own probe into how the three investigations fit within these new rules. Before that trial can even take place, House lawyers will need to comb through <em>Mazars</em> and likely make changes to the existing subpoenas so that they are more likely to survive judicial review. Even if the trial court does rule against Trump, that decision will be appealed to a lower appellate court — and the case could potentially be heard again by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"InFpar\">By the time this is all over, months or even years will have passed. If Trump loses the election, he’ll be a private citizen who no longer wields power over anyone.

And that’s assuming that Republicans do not regain control of the House and cancel the investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"D9R6wk\">Should a future Republican Congress wish to probe a future Democratic president, by contrast, that Congress will already know about the limits laid out in <em>Mazars</em>, so it will be able to tailor its subpoenas to those limits in advance.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

The movement pushed ideas about abolition further into the mainstream, changing the conversation around criminal justice reform.</p>\n<p id=\"bcx650\">Activists for police abolition see the two movements as intertwined, and say it isn’t a coincidence that both have risen to prominence in recent years.</p>\n<p id=\"VQQfDK\">“The activist communities that are involved in engaging people with the idea that we should defund the police or abolish the police or abolish ICE have a lot of cross-fertilization,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the University of Denver. “These are activists who often are people of color in communities where law enforcement agents of various types have a deleterious effect on them and the people around them. For lots of people who have been doing this work for many years, they view the police and ICE as working hand in hand.”</p>\n<p id=\"SYCBrS\">Movements to abolish ICE and the police have amassed significant support. By August 2018, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/08/27/few-democrats-favor-abolishing-ice-poll-finds/yz6spbXfJgnZJcSJaHcDUP/story.html\">about a quarter</a> of Democrats supported calls to dismantle the agency, and more than half had come to view the agency negatively. Similarly, polls conducted in the wake of recent protests have shown an almost <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/7/3/support-for-cutting-law-enforcement-funding-has-spiked\">15 percent increase</a> in support for cuts to law enforcement funding.</p>\n<p id=\"tsxJ7l\">It would be wrong to say that the movements’ messaging has had no impact, García Hernández said. “The notion of abolishing ICE has become one worthy of consideration by a much broader segment of society,” he said. “There has been an enormous shift.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"TsOtuE\">Advocates see abolishing police and abolishing ICE as part of the same movement</h3>\n<p id=\"MlqRIp\">Many of the organizations and movements calling for the abolition of ICE are the same ones that have been working to abolish the police; they see both moves as part of their objective to dismantle repressive law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"JndXAV\">By these activists’ definition, ICE, which has more than <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/about#wcm-survey-target-id\">20,000 agents</a> nationwide, operates as a police force that targets and criminalizes non-white communities.</p>\n<p id=\"4oEEFv\">“I don’t differentiate between abolishing the police and abolishing ICE,” said Monica Mohapatra, one of the authors of “<a href=\"https://www.8toabolition.com/\">#8toAbolition</a>,” a platform for police abolition. She listed ICE, along with sheriffs, highway patrol, campus police, school safety guards, corrections officers, and military officers, as among the forms of law enforcement that her group views as toxic.</p>\n<div id=\"Pp64wf\">\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Why America’s police look like soldiers|76253\" data-volume-uuid=\"e7fa896d3\" data-volume-id=\"76253\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-223\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div>\n\n</div>\n<p id=\"Zw6dkX\">The calls to abolish the police are informed by the work of migrant rights organizers who have opposed detention and family separations and sought to frame calls to “secure the border” as a product of American imperialism, Mohapatra added.</p>\n<p id=\"iQ5pXl\">Police have long worked in cooperation with ICE to arrest immigrants, leading to their detention and possible deportation. During recent Black Lives Matter protests in <a href=\"https://www.azmirror.com/2020/06/01/phoenix-police-wrongly-arrested-protesters-who-could-now-be-deported/\">Phoenix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/6/9/mizue_aizeki\">New York City</a>, ICE agents worked alongside police to take protesters into custody, even though that’s prohibited under the agency’s guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"MpQbJo\">ICE can send a written request to a local jail or other law enforcement entity asking officers to continue to detain immigrants for an additional 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released so that the agency can take them into custody and begin deportation proceedings. ICE doesn’t need court approval to issue these requests — it can do so even if an immigrant isn’t facing any pending charges, and without probable cause that they have committed any violation.</p>\n<p id=\"C5c9Uy\">ICE has access to a number of federal databases that help it identify immigrants to deport, including those of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the National Crime Information Center. But police can also informally share information with ICE to notify them of someone in their custody whom they suspect may have committed an immigration violation.</p>\n<p id=\"wAj5CV\">For many unauthorized immigrants, coming into contact with police for an offense as minor as a traffic violation could result in their deportation. Advocates have therefore understood the importance of police reform at the local level.</p>\n<p id=\"nWVGoP\">This cooperation between the two agencies is why some states and cities have adopted “sanctuary” policies barring local law enforcement from complying with detention requests or sharing information. The Supreme Court recently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/16/21291797/supreme-court-trump-immigration-sanctuary-california-values-act\">left in place</a> a California law that prevented most<strong> </strong>state and local law enforcement officials from providing detainees’ release dates or home addresses to ICE unless it’s already public information. That law also barred immigrants who have not been convicted of a crime from being transferred to immigration custody absent a court order, with some exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"Qb9D3X\">But those sanctuary policies can’t entirely shield immigrants from ICE’s reaches, and other states have taken the opposite tack, encouraging cooperation between police and ICE, such as with Arizona’s SB 1070. That controversial law was largely struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012, but one provision that still stands requires immigration status checks during law enforcement stops, arrests, and detention.</p>\n<p id=\"UfSktw\">“Immigrant rights activists have been very clear about engaging local elected officials for many years on policing reforms,” García Hernández said. “[Being stopped] in the street because of a traffic violation or because of some suspicion of criminal activity becomes the key moment that then sets the tone for whether or not this individual ends up in ICE’s hands and potentially getting deported.”</p>\n<p id=\"mDsW5c\">The movements to abolish the police and to abolish ICE often work in tandem. Some activists work on both causes, and others see their work as ideologically sympathetic.</p>\n<p id=\"n4Bh3P\">ICE and the police are “built on the same foundation of racism and white supremacy,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, one of the first organizations to call for abolishing immigration detention.</p>\n<p id=\"F6zd54\">“For police, it was to patrol and ‘catch’ enslaved people and protect white property and corporations. For ICE as an agency, it was an isolationist and Islamophobic response to the September 11th attacks,” she said. “The call to abolish ICE is a call to shift away from a system that targets, abuses, and exiles immigrants to one that values migration and human life.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"N4Bdmw\">Abolish ICE shifted the Overton window — but the movement’s goals are broader</h3>\n<p id=\"emPi6M\">Abolitionist ideas can be traced back to at least the 1960s and ’70s, when activists focused on mass incarceration. At the time, abolishing prisons felt “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/prison-abolition-america-impossible-inevitable\">almost inevitable</a>,” as Joshua Dubler and Vincent Lloyd wrote in the Guardian in 2018. Even a commission created by the Nixon administration, which later went on to espouse a “tough on crime” stance, proposed the closure of all juvenile prisons and acknowledged “overwhelming evidence that these institutions create crime rather than prevent it.”</p>\n<p id=\"BB4sIz\">But the ensuing decades brought crackdowns on both crime and immigration. The US experienced a crime wave that peaked in the early 1990s, with <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/americas-faulty-perception-crime-rates\">violent crimes</a> jumping almost fourfold during that period. The federal government reacted by increasing prison sentences, making it harder to challenge wrongful convictions, enabling police searches and seizures, and enacting strict criminal codes.</p>\n<p id=\"q45j06\">As crime dropped in the ’90s, the federal government turned its attention to immigration. In 1996, the Clinton administration backed what is now recognized as one of the most punitive immigration laws on the books, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11515132/iirira-clinton-immigration\">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</a>. The law, which was touted as centrist at the time, is largely responsible for the federal government’s massive detention and deportation engine as it exists today. It laid the groundwork for ICE’s creation in 2003 as a response to 9/11.</p>\n<p id=\"k4qVaC\">Immigrant advocates have opposed ICE since its inception, arguing that it has criminalized and unjustly targeted communities of color. But the agency didn’t attract widespread scrutiny until Donald Trump came into office and started using the agency to enforce his hardline immigration policies, especially the separation of immigrant families that began in 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"yziHaf\">“The view of the agency as something that was purely malignant really happened after Trump was elected and ramped up interior enforcement in a way that was tied pretty explicitly to the creation of a white ethnostate,” said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of nonprofit think tank Data for Progress who is credited with coining the #AbolishICE hashtag. </p>\n<p id=\"5qeEww\">The abolish ICE movement drew from that of abolishing prisons in developing strategies to “defund, shame, and create popular dissent around deportation,” Mohapatra said. Leading progressives, most notably Rep.

Take America’s biggest rental assistance program — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/10/21001692/housing-vouchers-discrimination-racism-landlords\">Section 8 housing vouchers</a> — and make it available to every family who qualifies. The current funding structure leaves out around 11 million people, simply because the pot allocated by Congress is too small. Then pair it with regulatory changes to help the housing market work better for more people. It’s the general consensus approach among top Democratic Party politicians and left-of-center policy wonks.</p>\n<p id=\"Md3oJr\">At the time when most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20681101/housing-crisis-democrats-2020-warren-harris-booker-castro\">presidential candidates were rolling out their housing plans</a>, Biden didn’t have one, dropping his instead right before the South Carolina primary when it was swiftly overshadowed by the dramatic shift in the campaign and then the Covid-19 pandemic. But precisely because the plan has not provoked much infighting and because key provisions would be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13709518/budget-reconciliation-explained\">budget reconciliation</a> treatment, which would require a majority vote in the Senate instead of a supermajority, it’s the kind of thing that really might happen in 2021 if Biden won. </p>\n<h3 id=\"viFRJs\">Universal housing vouchers, explained </h3>\n<p id=\"Lrci8a\">Federal housing assistance is something of a patchwork of different programs that includes the Section 8 voucher system, which arose in the mid-1970s when the Nixon and Ford administrations introduced it to incorporate market-oriented reforms into the welfare state. The way it works is that instead of the federal government spending money to build housing that is then rented at a discount to low-income people, the government gives low-income people vouchers that landlords can redeem for money and lets them rent whatever kind of house someone will rent to them.

      "contentSnippet": "Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n  Cut child poverty by a third, break down racial segregation, and stabilize the economy. Joe Biden has a housing policy agenda that is ambitious, technically sound, and politically feasible, and that would — if implemented — be life-changing for millions of low-income and housing-insecure households. \nAccording to original modeling by Columbia University scholars, it could cut child poverty by a third, narrow racial opportunity gaps, and potentially drive progress on the broader middle-class affordability crisis in the largest coastal cities as well. \nThe plan hasn’t stirred an intraparty debate or really much attention at all, which could make it politically feasible to enact. \n“Biden’s plan is bold, comprehensive, and will go a long way in making sure every American has a home,” Mary Cunningham, the vice president for metropolitan housing and communities policy at the Urban Institute, tells me. “It’s plainly obvious, in the middle of this pandemic, that home is more important than ever.”\nThe centerpiece is simple. Take America’s biggest rental assistance program — Section 8 housing vouchers — and make it available to every family who qualifies. The current funding structure leaves out around 11 million people, simply because the pot allocated by Congress is too small. Then pair it with regulatory changes to help the housing market work better for more people. It’s the general consensus approach among top Democratic Party politicians and left-of-center policy wonks.\nAt the time when most presidential candidates were rolling out their housing plans, Biden didn’t have one, dropping his instead right before the South Carolina primary when it was swiftly overshadowed by the dramatic shift in the campaign and then the Covid-19 pandemic. But precisely because the plan has not provoked much infighting and because key provisions would be eligible for budget reconciliation treatment, which would require a majority vote in the Senate instead of a supermajority, it’s the kind of thing that really might happen in 2021 if Biden won. \nUniversal housing vouchers, explained \nFederal housing assistance is something of a patchwork of different programs that includes the Section 8 voucher system, which arose in the mid-1970s when the Nixon and Ford administrations introduced it to incorporate market-oriented reforms into the welfare state. The way it works is that instead of the federal government spending money to build housing that is then rented at a discount to low-income people, the government gives low-income people vouchers that landlords can redeem for money and lets them rent whatever kind of house someone will rent to them. Since the voucher program, when created, became Section 8 of the US Housing Act of 1937, the vouchers have come to be known as Section 8 vouchers.   \nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that more than 5 million people receive help from the program. \nIt has various flaws, including, most notably, the widespread discrimination against voucher tenants that Stephanie Wykstra has written about for Vox. Another huge flaw is that that, unlike Medicaid or SNAP — which, at least in theory, provide benefits to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria — Section 8 is capped in the amount of money available to it by the whims of Congress. As it stands, about three-quarters of eligible people don’t get the help because there simply isn’t enough money in the pot, which is a huge missed opportunity to improve the lives of millions of Americans.\nCBPP data shows that receipt of housing vouchers leads to a decline in children experiencing separation from their parents, a decline in domestic violence, a decline in food insecurity, and, most of all, a steep decline in housing instability.\n  \n        \n      Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n  \nThe idea of funding the program at the full level to meet family needs has existed for decades. But multiple DC-based housing policy wonks tell me it was Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book about housing instability in Milwaukee, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, that helped put it on more people’s radars. \nIt’s a heartbreaking book, and the epilogue speaks about vouchers in a way that stretches beyond the arcana of federal budge policy: “A universal housing voucher program would carve a middle path between the landlord’s desire to make a living and the tenant’s desire, simply, to live.”\nStephanie Collyer and Chris Wimer of Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy helped me quantify the impact more precisely with a mathematical model.

Mifflin High School in Shillington, Pennsylvania, on May 1, 2020. | Ben Hasty/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images</small>\n\n  <p>Six questions about the safety of kids, teachers, and families, answered.</p> <p id=\"KXidGN\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">Covid-19</a> is upending our lives and forcing us to make complex decisions with little information and conflicting guidance from authorities. Summer, typically the season of staying up late and popsicles in the park, offers no escape. Many of us are already turning to the fall, and the fate of schools.</p>\n<p id=\"Dg25BL\">What will we do with our kids? Can we really send them back to school? If we keep them at home, will they forget how to read? If we send them to school, what might be the consequence? We are living a nightmare, but this is where we are. The choices are high-stakes and plagued by uncertainty. Even thinking about them makes me sweat.</p>\n<p id=\"nuIan9\">I am the father of three girls ages 16, 13, and 10, and like every parent in America, I am worried about the fall. </p>\n<p id=\"LRscTd\">I’m also an infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist, and have spent the past four months drinking from the fire hose of Covid-19 science, designing infection control policies for my hospital, and caring for patients on the front line. I serve on the reopening committee for my synagogue and for my school district. I consult for businesses as they reopen. </p>\n<aside id=\"wV8ga6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Reopening schools safely is going to take much more federal leadership\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/8/21314563/school-reopening-testing-money\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"1xDJPC\">I have a first-row seat to the coronavirus pandemic, both as a parent and as a professional. In both of those roles, I hear the same questions, repeated with mounting urgency: “Are our kids going to be safe?” “Are our teachers going to be safe?” “Will kids bring Covid-19 home to our family?” “Will opening schools lead to a second wave and lockdown?” “What are the risks of not reopening?”</p>\n<p id=\"dTOmcb\">I have spent time reviewing the data and seeking answers to the challenging questions we face. Having the knowledge to make your own assessment, however, need not be a position of professional privilege. With this short primer, I hope you can add your voice to the debate and advocate for yourself, your family, and your community.  The good news is, we can hope to send kids back to school in the fall, but there is a lot of work to do.</p>\n<div id=\"B595ky\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6CJbzzCZaRRhDFn2CBwyni\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"0oHduN\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"Pd09Za\">Are our kids going to be safe?</h3>\n<p id=\"kJ8nlu\">If any of us is ever going to send our kids to school again, we need a clear answer. Fortunately, I think we have one, at least for the children. Children are less likely than adults to be infected with Covid-19. There are multiple ways to study this question, and all the approaches arrive at this same conclusion. </p>\n<p id=\"bkVA2O\">First, when we look at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm\">public health reporting</a>, children under the age of 18 make up only 2 percent of cases in the US, even though they represent 22 percent of the total population. Similar studies in <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jpids/piaa070/5849922\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting\">Massachusetts</a> found that children make up fewer Covid-19 cases than expected, as have studies in <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100?query=C19&amp;cid=DM90478_NEJM_COVID-19_Newsletter&amp;bid=185523657\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036368v1.full.pdf\">South Korea</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1\">Iceland</a>. For me, that is a lot of similar results for this to be a fluke. When one study in one location produces a finding, it is notable. When five studies from five different settings find the same thing, it is compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"lZXeFH\">One reason case counts may be lower among kids than would be expected is that we <em>did </em>close our schools in March. Maybe we protected our kids by keeping them out of harm’s way. But if we send them back to school this fall, will they still enjoy protected status from the coronavirus? </p>\n<p id=\"yOjmGA\">One way to study this question is to estimate the “attack rate” of the disease — that is, the proportion of people exposed who become infected. Multiple studies from China investigated the attack rate among people living in a house with someone who is infected. They found that only about 4 to 5 percent of kids developed an active infection. In comparison, about 17 to 20 percent of adults became infected after exposure. </p>\n<p id=\"3XVKow\">To be fair, data in the US is more concerning. In <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa549/5831986\">New York state</a>, 57 percent of people living with a Covid-infected person developed an infection. It is hard to take reassurance from that fact. But even with such a high attack rate, children were still less likely to develop an infection and there was a gradient over ages, a sort of “dose effect” for age.</p>\n<p id=\"o7ROAm\">Finally, even in the worst-case scenario, in which a child does contract Covid-19, the outcomes of the disease are less severe in younger people than among older adults. In <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32519809/\">one analysis</a> of more than 550 confirmed cases among children under age 18 in China, Italy, and Spain, only nine people (1.6 percent) had severe or critical disease. In <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179660/\">another study</a>, approximately 5 percent (one out of 20) developed symptoms that required hospitalization, but only 0.6 percent required intensive care. In comparison, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6924e2.htm\">a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report</a> indicates that among those ages 60 to 69 who have the coronavirus, 22 percent require hospitalization and 4 percent require intensive care.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Lt7ZVa\">Are teachers going to be safe?</h3>\n<p id=\"iUA25q\">There is far less data specifically on teachers and staff than on kids. <a href=\"https://www.pasteur.fr/fr/file/35404/download\">One study in France</a> is reassuring. In that investigation of 541 students and 46 teachers, there were no documented transmission events from students to teachers. However, while many of us immediately think of the risk to teachers from exposure in the classroom, we may not consider the additional risk that teachers face in break rooms and staff meetings. </p>\n<p id=\"XT5LxL\">Working in the hospital, I have personally seen that staff have a difficult time maintaining personal protection at all times. Doctors and nurses tend to let down their guard when they are away from patients and during breaks.

All of this data tells us that despite our gut instincts and parental anxiety, schools will likely be okay this fall.</p>\n<p id=\"vJvMwX\">But the story does not end there. First, there are examples of in-school outbreaks that did force a second shutdown. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered\">Israel is an example</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"yGxya3\">Israel reopened schools with limited class sizes in early May and lifted class size restrictions on May 17. By June 3, they had to reclose after a major outbreak. The largest outbreak was 116 students and 14 teachers at one school. Per <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/03/868507524/israel-orders-schools-to-close-when-covid-19-cases-are-discovered\">NPR</a>, one child tested positive without symptoms and the school decided to quarantine the grade. Next, a child in a different grade tested positive and they closed the school. </p>\n<p id=\"SfQEbC\">At that time, they discovered that they already had more than 100 cases. It is not certain that all of those children were infected in the school, but the story is concerning and it raises the bar on monitoring our schools.</p>\n<p id=\"1HrUcS\">The data that’s available is mixed. If a person (or school district) wants to tell you that schools play little role in transmission, then ask them how their district is different from Israel’s. Why can an outbreak happen in that setting but not yours? Perhaps there is a reason, but until someone can give you a good one, be skeptical.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cn9MO9\">What are the risks of not reopening?</h3>\n<p id=\"b6W7Jc\">A discussion of school closures that focuses only on Covid-19 and not at all on education is incomplete. There are real risks to keeping our children at home. In fact, the risks of staying home are in many ways clearer than the risks of returning to school. </p>\n<p id=\"QptWVC\"><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime?cid=eml-web#\">One study</a> using statistical models projects major losses in math performance if we continue with remote learning until 2021. Perhaps more compelling than statistics, however, is some simple common sense. </p>\n<p id=\"w8afMf\">On any given day, it is hard to point to the loss of learning from home. At the same time, we all agree that education is essential. If we keep our kids home for another school year, they will have missed 12 percent of their total education. I cannot identify the specific losses from that much absence, but I am confident there is a cost to missing that much school. For perspective, missing 12 percent of school time is the same as missing 22 days of school in a single year.</p>\n<p id=\"rLyDZz\">Further, the losses will not be equal. The “Covid-19 slide” will likely be greatest among the socially vulnerable, such as children with learning disabilities and those whose situation at home is not conducive to homeschooling. </p>\n<p id=\"J6uGb4\">We must also acknowledge that the losses will hit people of color much harder than those who are white. Further, school officials account for approximately 20 percent of formal reports of child abuse and domestic violence. Without school-based counselors and social workers, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766822?guestAccessKey=954a967e-5290-4762-a461-b049c949ca51&amp;utm_source=fbpage&amp;utm_medium=social_jama&amp;utm_term=3388004779&amp;utm_campaign=article_alert&amp;linkId=89913135\">these concerns may not be investigated</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"b4A2jt\">All of these harms weighed on the <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/\">American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidance</a> that school reopening plans start with the goal of having students be physically present in schools.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lqMwtnaRlBOdXlwwm-Cz8oZz2I=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20074752/GettyImages_1254651670.jpg\">\n      <cite>Alejandra Villa Loarca/Newsday RM via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Nicole Venditti watches as her 9-year-old son Andrew gets his temperature taken before boarding the school bus outside their Merrick, New York, home on July 2, 2020.

The central question to all decision-science is: “What should we do, given that we have imperfect information?” </p>\n<p id=\"2cxiyZ\">Milt is fond of the expression “a decision has to be made.” His wisdom has never been more pertinent than it is today. We have to make a decision. There is no choice to do nothing, because either way — go to school or learn remotely — we are making a decision. </p>\n<aside id=\"XC6Zeb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"A doctor on how to make Covid-19 decisions when so much is unknown\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/14/21258576/n95-masks-coronavirus-covid-19-schools\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"sO3Ong\">Unfortunately for all of us, we are making a decision with significant uncertainty about all the risks involved. Fortunately, this is not the first time that people have been forced to make decisions with uncertainty. There are approaches to making uncertain decisions in a way that maximizes the chances of a good outcome and minimizes the harm if the outcome is poor. </p>\n<p id=\"lqUlgU\">You’ve likely heard of one of them: hedging your bets. When multibillion-dollar investment funds make a choice to invest, they recognize that they could be wrong. They do not make all-in versus out decisions. Instead, they hedge their bets. They may think that the newest beach toy is destined for greatness, but just in case of a rainy summer, they also invest in umbrellas. </p>\n<p id=\"5M8apc\">When I look across all the data, I see an uncertain decision. First, I propose that the balance of data that we have now suggests that we need to try to open schools in the fall. The risks of reopening are uncertain; the harm of staying home is clear. </p>\n<p id=\"3oIwAM\">If your school district cites the data above to you that “schools are safe,” ask your school board: What is the plan beyond reopening? What if we are wrong? How will your district know that things are going well (or not well)? Don’t let the conversation stop at “data suggests that schools are safe.” Don’t let the plan stop with “symptomatic people should call their doctor.” </p>\n<p id=\"FKKy73\">If we are going to open safely in the fall, we must have the capacity to know — quickly — when an outbreak occurs. Israel is an important cautionary tale. When Israel closed down its schools again, it had only identified two school-based cases, yet in the end it discovered that more than 100 students had been infected.</p>\n<p id=\"y8YxTT\">To do this well, and to do it safely, we must have school-based Covid-19 symptom screening, testing, contact tracing, and isolation. “School-based testing” does not mean that the test themselves must occur in school buildings. “School-based testing” means that students and teachers can easily access a test by contacting the school, and that the results of those tests are sent directly to the school district in real time. </p>\n<p id=\"rz6a3K\">That seems straightforward, but it is not. The community does not yet have adequate testing, contact tracing, or isolation. Schools currently have nothing. </p>\n<p id=\"zlXqDd\">It requires building new capacity in schools for testing and contact tracing. It requires a budget. It requires a formal plan. Ideally, that budget should come from the federal government and be directed to states and ultimately school districts, as part of a national Covid-19 testing strategy. Realistically, given the lack of any such national plan, the funds need to come from individual states. </p>\n<p id=\"J5XjuM\">Building such infrastructure comes at a cost and many districts are already facing budget shortfalls. Districts that rely only on their existing testing infrastructure will not have the real-time information they need to make good decisions. Imagine a child has a fever and cough in October and is told by the school to call the doctor for a Covid-19 test. Results are typically returned in two days to the doctor’s office. After another day (or two), the data might make it to the school district. So it will take at least four to five days for the district to have any information.</p>\n<p id=\"hxIWIN\">We need testing within the school system to shorten the delay at every step of the process and reduce the turnaround time for the test to only a day. With that kind of time resolution, we can increase awareness of the situation at our schools, along with the ability to react appropriately. Without it, we are flying blind and gambling with the health of our children, teachers, and community.</p>\n<p id=\"volloq\">Ultimately, when I look at the decision about school as both a father and a scientist, I see a difficult decision that must be made despite uncertainty. The risks of opening are uncertain, but the benefits are clear. We need to try to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"evZlaM\">We have been wrong before about Covid-19. In March, the epidemiology world was quite confident that transmission could not occur before a person develops symptoms. Three months later, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/10/21286426/can-asymptomatic-people-spread-coronavirus-who-transmission\">there is consensus</a> that asymptomatic people were likely one of the main drivers of the pandemic. In March, the CDC and the US surgeon general told the public that masks play no role in controlling the spread of the disease. Now we see <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/29/21273625/coronavirus-masks-required-virginia-china-hong-kong\">masks as a central component of our reopening strategies</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"0pRCtl\">We could be wrong about schools, but we cannot afford to wait to find out for certain. We need school-based Covid-19 symptom screening, testing, contact tracing, and isolation. Opening without a plan to test is irresponsible and a gamble with our children’s health.  </p>\n<p id=\"npiLpf\"><em>Benjamin P.

      "contentSnippet": "Gov. Mifflin High School in Shillington, Pennsylvania, on May 1, 2020. | Ben Hasty/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images\n\n  Six questions about the safety of kids, teachers, and families, answered. Covid-19 is upending our lives and forcing us to make complex decisions with little information and conflicting guidance from authorities. Summer, typically the season of staying up late and popsicles in the park, offers no escape. Many of us are already turning to the fall, and the fate of schools.\nWhat will we do with our kids? Can we really send them back to school? If we keep them at home, will they forget how to read? If we send them to school, what might be the consequence? We are living a nightmare, but this is where we are. The choices are high-stakes and plagued by uncertainty. Even thinking about them makes me sweat.\nI am the father of three girls ages 16, 13, and 10, and like every parent in America, I am worried about the fall. \nI’m also an infectious disease doctor and epidemiologist, and have spent the past four months drinking from the fire hose of Covid-19 science, designing infection control policies for my hospital, and caring for patients on the front line. I serve on the reopening committee for my synagogue and for my school district. I consult for businesses as they reopen. \nI have a first-row seat to the coronavirus pandemic, both as a parent and as a professional. In both of those roles, I hear the same questions, repeated with mounting urgency: “Are our kids going to be safe?” “Are our teachers going to be safe?” “Will kids bring Covid-19 home to our family?” “Will opening schools lead to a second wave and lockdown?” “What are the risks of not reopening?”\nI have spent time reviewing the data and seeking answers to the challenging questions we face. Having the knowledge to make your own assessment, however, need not be a position of professional privilege. With this short primer, I hope you can add your voice to the debate and advocate for yourself, your family, and your community.  The good news is, we can hope to send kids back to school in the fall, but there is a lot of work to do.\n\n\nAre our kids going to be safe?\nIf any of us is ever going to send our kids to school again, we need a clear answer. Fortunately, I think we have one, at least for the children. Children are less likely than adults to be infected with Covid-19. There are multiple ways to study this question, and all the approaches arrive at this same conclusion. \nFirst, when we look at public health reporting, children under the age of 18 make up only 2 percent of cases in the US, even though they represent 22 percent of the total population. Similar studies in Chicago and Massachusetts found that children make up fewer Covid-19 cases than expected, as have studies in Italy, South Korea, and Iceland. For me, that is a lot of similar results for this to be a fluke. When one study in one location produces a finding, it is notable. When five studies from five different settings find the same thing, it is compelling.\nOne reason case counts may be lower among kids than would be expected is that we did close our schools in March. Maybe we protected our kids by keeping them out of harm’s way. But if we send them back to school this fall, will they still enjoy protected status from the coronavirus? \nOne way to study this question is to estimate the “attack rate” of the disease — that is, the proportion of people exposed who become infected. Multiple studies from China investigated the attack rate among people living in a house with someone who is infected. They found that only about 4 to 5 percent of kids developed an active infection. In comparison, about 17 to 20 percent of adults became infected after exposure. \nTo be fair, data in the US is more concerning. In New York state, 57 percent of people living with a Covid-infected person developed an infection. It is hard to take reassurance from that fact. But even with such a high attack rate, children were still less likely to develop an infection and there was a gradient over ages, a sort of “dose effect” for age.\nFinally, even in the worst-case scenario, in which a child does contract Covid-19, the outcomes of the disease are less severe in younger people than among older adults. In one analysis of more than 550 confirmed cases among children under age 18 in China, Italy, and Spain, only nine people (1.6 percent) had severe or critical disease. In another study, approximately 5 percent (one out of 20) developed symptoms that required hospitalization, but only 0.6 percent required intensive care. In comparison, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report indicates that among those ages 60 to 69 who have the coronavirus, 22 percent require hospitalization and 4 percent require intensive care.\nAre teachers going to be safe?\nThere is far less data specifically on teachers and staff than on kids. One study in France is reassuring. In that investigation of 541 students and 46 teachers, there were no documented transmission events from students to teachers. However, while many of us immediately think of the risk to teachers from exposure in the classroom, we may not consider the additional risk that teachers face in break rooms and staff meetings. \nWorking in the hospital, I have personally seen that staff have a difficult time maintaining personal protection at all times. Doctors and nurses tend to let down their guard when they are away from patients and during breaks. Masks come down, people eat snacks in potentially unsafe spaces, and social distancing lessens. \nThe same will likely be true in schools. The potential risk to teachers, therefore, goes beyond the classroom. Staff risk in schools likely looks similar to the risk of any adult working in a crowded indoor environment during the pandemic. School opening plans must consider teacher safety in addition to the well-being of students.\n  \n        \n      Michael Loccisano/Getty Images\n      A calendar in a classroom shows the date of the last class in session at Yung Wing School P.S. 124 on June 9, 2020, in New York City.\n  \nWill my kids bring Covid-19 home to our family?\nFor most parents, the next question after the safety of their kids will be their own safety and that of loved ones in the house. Even if the kids are all right, could they bring the coronavirus home? \nHere, again, the data appears reassuring. One large review of over 700 scientific publications found that children accounted for only a small fraction of Covid-19 cases, and that they were rarely the first case in a cluster of infections in a household. For example, in China, only 5 percent of household clusters were found to have a child as the index case. Similarly, in Switzerland and Holland, children accounted for only 8 percent of household transmission clusters.\nUnfortunately, the US numbers make me a little less certain. In a Chicago study of 15 households with available data, 73 percent of infected children contracted the virus from an adult. However, that means that 27 percent of infections were child-to-child, which is substantially more than 5 to 8 percent. \nStill, the Chicago study only examined 15 households, and adult-to-child transmission remained far more common than child-to-child or child-to-adult. \nWill someone in America contract Covid-19 from their sick child? Yes. Should I structure my life around such a rare occurrence? I do not think so.\nWill opening schools lead to a second wave and more lockdowns?\nWe have reached the most challenging question to answer and one that is a holy grail for Covid-19 epidemiologists. I want to give you the plain answer here — we do not know.  \nAn objective summary of the evidence in hand suggests that schools will play little role in sustaining the pandemic. A recent review of 210 transmission clusters around the world found that only eight of them (3.8 percent) involved school transmission. Case studies of outbreak investigations in Ireland, France, and Australia demonstrate almost zero cases of in-school transmission. \nModeling studies demonstrate no clear role of in-school transmission in explaining current Covid-19 epidemiology. All of this data tells us that despite our gut instincts and parental anxiety, schools will likely be okay this fall.\nBut the story does not end there. First, there are examples of in-school outbreaks that did force a second shutdown. Israel is an example. \nIsrael reopened schools with limited class sizes in early May and lifted class size restrictions on May 17. By June 3, they had to reclose after a major outbreak. The largest outbreak was 116 students and 14 teachers at one school. Per NPR, one child tested positive without symptoms and the school decided to quarantine the grade. Next, a child in a different grade tested positive and they closed the school. \nAt that time, they discovered that they already had more than 100 cases. It is not certain that all of those children were infected in the school, but the story is concerning and it raises the bar on monitoring our schools.\nThe data that’s available is mixed. If a person (or school district) wants to tell you that schools play little role in transmission, then ask them how their district is different from Israel’s. Why can an outbreak happen in that setting but not yours? Perhaps there is a reason, but until someone can give you a good one, be skeptical.\nWhat are the risks of not reopening?\nA discussion of school closures that focuses only on Covid-19 and not at all on education is incomplete. There are real risks to keeping our children at home. In fact, the risks of staying home are in many ways clearer than the risks of returning to school. \nOne study using statistical models projects major losses in math performance if we continue with remote learning until 2021.

When Israel closed down its schools again, it had only identified two school-based cases, yet in the end it discovered that more than 100 students had been infected.\nTo do this well, and to do it safely, we must have school-based Covid-19 symptom screening, testing, contact tracing, and isolation. “School-based testing” does not mean that the test themselves must occur in school buildings. “School-based testing” means that students and teachers can easily access a test by contacting the school, and that the results of those tests are sent directly to the school district in real time. \nThat seems straightforward, but it is not. The community does not yet have adequate testing, contact tracing, or isolation. Schools currently have nothing. \nIt requires building new capacity in schools for testing and contact tracing. It requires a budget. It requires a formal plan. Ideally, that budget should come from the federal government and be directed to states and ultimately school districts, as part of a national Covid-19 testing strategy. Realistically, given the lack of any such national plan, the funds need to come from individual states. \nBuilding such infrastructure comes at a cost and many districts are already facing budget shortfalls. Districts that rely only on their existing testing infrastructure will not have the real-time information they need to make good decisions. Imagine a child has a fever and cough in October and is told by the school to call the doctor for a Covid-19 test. Results are typically returned in two days to the doctor’s office. After another day (or two), the data might make it to the school district. So it will take at least four to five days for the district to have any information.\nWe need testing within the school system to shorten the delay at every step of the process and reduce the turnaround time for the test to only a day. With that kind of time resolution, we can increase awareness of the situation at our schools, along with the ability to react appropriately. Without it, we are flying blind and gambling with the health of our children, teachers, and community.\nUltimately, when I look at the decision about school as both a father and a scientist, I see a difficult decision that must be made despite uncertainty. The risks of opening are uncertain, but the benefits are clear. We need to try to reopen.\nWe have been wrong before about Covid-19. In March, the epidemiology world was quite confident that transmission could not occur before a person develops symptoms. Three months later, there is consensus that asymptomatic people were likely one of the main drivers of the pandemic. In March, the CDC and the US surgeon general told the public that masks play no role in controlling the spread of the disease. Now we see masks as a central component of our reopening strategies.\nWe could be wrong about schools, but we cannot afford to wait to find out for certain. We need school-based Covid-19 symptom screening, testing, contact tracing, and isolation. Opening without a plan to test is irresponsible and a gamble with our children’s health.  \nBenjamin P.

They worked together to get the word out, and just a few days later, somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people gathered in the streets of Simi Valley to protest Floyd’s killing and show support for Black Lives Matter.</p>\n<p id=\"oTP0m8\">The crowd was diverse. “It was honestly the most people of color I’ve seen in one space in Simi in my entire life,” Foster said.</p>\n<p id=\"fydjqs\">But there were also lots of white people, who make up <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/simivalleycitycalifornia\">nearly 80 percent of the city’s population</a>; just over 1 percent of residents are Black.

But it was only after the death of George Floyd that he felt he had to be in the streets. “I couldn’t sit idly by and just let this happen,” he said.</p>\n<p id=\"DjT9yz\">Linda Beck Kuban, who’s also white, helped organize a candlelight vigil for Floyd in nearby Thousand Oaks. She said she protested in support of the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s but began paying more attention to racial inequality specifically in recent years, after the uprising in Ferguson and the election of President Trump. “The racism became very overt in the Trump administration,” she said. “Not that it wasn’t there before, it’s never left. But he and his people brought it out, they gave it permission.”</p>\n<p id=\"Zuocyn\">Meanwhile, for Foster, the protest was a big moment in a place where “oftentimes you’re the only person of color in your class.” And Simi Valley isn’t just majority white — it’s also known for its connection to the Los Angeles Police Department. Historically, locals called the city <a href=\"https://www.laweekly.com/copland/\">“Copland”</a> because it was home to so many police officers. And in the wake of the Rodney King trial, the city became synonymous in the minds of many with racism, white flight, and “above all, white cops,” <a href=\"https://www.laweekly.com/copland/\">Steven Mikulan wrote at LA Weekly in 2002</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"bZKN7E\">Now, the protests show “how much we’re changing,” Foster said, noting that friends who graduated from high school in the city just a few years ago were telling her things like, “I never would’ve imagined anything like that would ever happen in Simi.”</p>\n<aside id=\"WIeHOe\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The legacy of Black Lives Matter\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/6/21311171/black-lives-matter-legacy\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"bJbBag\">It wasn’t just the June 6 protest; Foster helped organize another protest on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21294825/history-of-juneteenth\">Juneteenth</a> that also drew a large crowd. And the city recently had its first Pride event in over 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"nBeAK8\">“It shows how diverse we’re becoming, and how we’re becoming more and more accepting,” Foster said. “It’s not just a majority white, conservative town anymore.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"uwJmn8\">White people are turning out to protest around the country. Will it last?</h3>\n<p id=\"1T7Ewt\">The same thing is happening around the country, as white people in traditionally Republican areas of the country turn out to show their support for Black Lives Matter and their opposition to police violence. For example, a march was organized in Vidor, Texas, a formerly all-white town and stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan, <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">as Texas Monthly reported</a>. Residents in <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/06/12/why-rural-america-is-joining-the-movement-for-black-lives\">majority-white St. Helens, Oregon, and Harlan, Kentucky,</a> demonstrated as well.</p>\n<p id=\"BYomvd\">In addition to protesting, white people are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/6/11/21286642/george-floyd-protests-white-people-police-racism\">expressing more support for Black Lives Matter</a>, more openness to (some) changes to policing, and a greater desire to learn about racism than in years past. But the question for many is whether those attitudes will translate into sustained action. “Part of why a lot of white Americans are turning out to protest is we’re in the midst of a really unusual circumstance,” Jardina said. Because of the pandemic and the resulting lockdowns, a lot of white people “are able to sit at home, and pay attention to news, and think about something bigger than themselves.” </p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7NeisT53v-ooYDwF7YResZLHXY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20072283/Black_Lives_Matter_2300.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>Over the past month, marches have taken place in more than 40 countries and<strong> </strong>2,000 American cities, compared with 100 US cities in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/si5nSIkt2Np0h3to3ZdM7UlgOmU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20073250/Black_Lives_Matter_5798.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>Dr. Jewel Jackson leads a dance on Juneteenth in Simi Valley.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2Ehl2I0AHBid9COSgaAxNrxSFg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20072284/Black_Lives_Matter_5866.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>Supporters of Black Lives Matter in Simi Valley on Juneteenth.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"FaUAGJ\">The pandemic is also causing many white Americans to question systems they once took for granted, especially as some have to file for unemployment for the first time or see government loans going to big corporations instead of their own small businesses, Veronica Womack, executive director of the Rural Studies Institute at Georgia College &amp; State University, told Vox. </p>\n<p id=\"Igfr3L\">The events of the past few months, from federal and state governments’ botched handling of the pandemic to the killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans, have many Black people and other people of color saying “we can do better than this,” Womack said. And “we now have white people saying the same thing, and really being able to personally feel it.”</p>\n<p id=\"9GkB4O\">But as the pandemic drags on, attention could drift. Because they’re not confronted with racism every day, white Americans could convince themselves that “the change has happened” and the goals of the protests have been accomplished, Jardina said.</p>\n<p id=\"ip5TLm\">Many wonder whether the white people who protested in Simi Valley in June will still be involved in activism in the fall and beyond. How will they vote in November? And as the larger movement for racial equity continues, what should be the role of the white people around the country who are newly interested in joining the cause?</p>\n<p id=\"S9l8RX\">Shultz, for his part, plans to keep going. “This definitely kind of ignited a spark within me to not only come out to protests for Black Lives Matter but for many other protests that are going on,” he said. And for other white people newly active in this moment, he advises, “it is a marathon, not a sprint.” </p>\n<p id=\"PKUskc\">“We need to have these conversations, we need to be posting on our social media, talking to our friends, our family, our coworkers, anybody that’ll listen,” he said. “And we need to vote.”</p>\n<p id=\"NLVC0Z\">For Foster, meanwhile, “it’s not necessarily about white people using their voice to uplift our voices, it’s about them using their platform to let us uplift our own voices.” White people may recognize what Black and other people of color experience, “but you don’t really know how it feels, and you can’t know how it feels.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aBo7_49dPwZdU5jh9YRlF5qwL3Y=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20072240/Black_Lives_Matter_4112.jpg\">\n      <figcaption>A candlelight vigil for George Floyd on June 9 in Thousand Oaks, California.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"MBB5gM\">“In terms of how to be the best white ally,” she said, “I think it’s really important to let people of color speak on it and maybe quiet your own voice so that we can amplify ours.”</p>\n<p id=\"ejb3IW\"><a href=\"https://archive.toddbigelowphotography.com/portfolio/G00007E2ldg0P3Yo\"><em>Todd Bigelow</em></a><em> is an editorial photographer with Contact Press Images based in Los Angeles, California.

Thousand Oaks and its neighboring&nbsp;suburbs&nbsp;have traditionally been strongholds for the&nbsp;Republican Party&nbsp;in Ventura County. | Todd Bigelow/Contact Press Images\n\n\n  What protests in a conservative enclave of California tell us about a changing America.

But it was only after the death of George Floyd that he felt he had to be in the streets. “I couldn’t sit idly by and just let this happen,” he said.\nLinda Beck Kuban, who’s also white, helped organize a candlelight vigil for Floyd in nearby Thousand Oaks. She said she protested in support of the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s but began paying more attention to racial inequality specifically in recent years, after the uprising in Ferguson and the election of President Trump. “The racism became very overt in the Trump administration,” she said. “Not that it wasn’t there before, it’s never left. But he and his people brought it out, they gave it permission.”\nMeanwhile, for Foster, the protest was a big moment in a place where “oftentimes you’re the only person of color in your class.” And Simi Valley isn’t just majority white — it’s also known for its connection to the Los Angeles Police Department. Historically, locals called the city “Copland” because it was home to so many police officers. And in the wake of the Rodney King trial, the city became synonymous in the minds of many with racism, white flight, and “above all, white cops,” Steven Mikulan wrote at LA Weekly in 2002.\nNow, the protests show “how much we’re changing,” Foster said, noting that friends who graduated from high school in the city just a few years ago were telling her things like, “I never would’ve imagined anything like that would ever happen in Simi.”\nIt wasn’t just the June 6 protest; Foster helped organize another protest on Juneteenth that also drew a large crowd. And the city recently had its first Pride event in over 20 years.\n“It shows how diverse we’re becoming, and how we’re becoming more and more accepting,” Foster said. “It’s not just a majority white, conservative town anymore.”\nWhite people are turning out to protest around the country. Will it last?\nThe same thing is happening around the country, as white people in traditionally Republican areas of the country turn out to show their support for Black Lives Matter and their opposition to police violence. For example, a march was organized in Vidor, Texas, a formerly all-white town and stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan, as Texas Monthly reported. Residents in majority-white St. Helens, Oregon, and Harlan, Kentucky, demonstrated as well.\nIn addition to protesting, white people are expressing more support for Black Lives Matter, more openness to (some) changes to policing, and a greater desire to learn about racism than in years past. But the question for many is whether those attitudes will translate into sustained action. “Part of why a lot of white Americans are turning out to protest is we’re in the midst of a really unusual circumstance,” Jardina said. Because of the pandemic and the resulting lockdowns, a lot of white people “are able to sit at home, and pay attention to news, and think about something bigger than themselves.” \n\n  \n        \n      Over the past month, marches have taken place in more than 40 countries and 2,000 American cities, compared with 100 US cities in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Dr. Jewel Jackson leads a dance on Juneteenth in Simi Valley.\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Supporters of Black Lives Matter in Simi Valley on Juneteenth.\n  \n\n\n\nThe pandemic is also causing many white Americans to question systems they once took for granted, especially as some have to file for unemployment for the first time or see government loans going to big corporations instead of their own small businesses, Veronica Womack, executive director of the Rural Studies Institute at Georgia College & State University, told Vox. \nThe events of the past few months, from federal and state governments’ botched handling of the pandemic to the killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans, have many Black people and other people of color saying “we can do better than this,” Womack said. And “we now have white people saying the same thing, and really being able to personally feel it.”\nBut as the pandemic drags on, attention could drift. Because they’re not confronted with racism every day, white Americans could convince themselves that “the change has happened” and the goals of the protests have been accomplished, Jardina said.\nMany wonder whether the white people who protested in Simi Valley in June will still be involved in activism in the fall and beyond. How will they vote in November? And as the larger movement for racial equity continues, what should be the role of the white people around the country who are newly interested in joining the cause?\nShultz, for his part, plans to keep going. “This definitely kind of ignited a spark within me to not only come out to protests for Black Lives Matter but for many other protests that are going on,” he said. And for other white people newly active in this moment, he advises, “it is a marathon, not a sprint.” \n“We need to have these conversations, we need to be posting on our social media, talking to our friends, our family, our coworkers, anybody that’ll listen,” he said. “And we need to vote.”\nFor Foster, meanwhile, “it’s not necessarily about white people using their voice to uplift our voices, it’s about them using their platform to let us uplift our own voices.” White people may recognize what Black and other people of color experience, “but you don’t really know how it feels, and you can’t know how it feels.”\n  \n        \n      A candlelight vigil for George Floyd on June 9 in Thousand Oaks, California.\n  \n\n“In terms of how to be the best white ally,” she said, “I think it’s really important to let people of color speak on it and maybe quiet your own voice so that we can amplify ours.”\nTodd Bigelow is an editorial photographer with Contact Press Images based in Los Angeles, California.

Bernie Sanders has released a <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf\">detailed set of policy recommendations</a> for an incoming Biden administration, if he wins the November election. </p>\n<p id=\"JvEEPp\">The administration it imagines — while not so progressive that it would embrace<strong> </strong>plans like Medicare-for-all or a jobs guarantee — would push for one of the largest public sector investments in decades. On Wednesday night, a senior campaign aide described Biden’s forthcoming economic plan as the “largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure and [research and development] since World War II.” <strong> </strong></p>\n<p id=\"sbHZGL\">It’s also a sign of Biden’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1280862834516275200\">success in his ongoing push to unite the party</a>: Numerous progressives on the task force chosen by Sanders told Vox they were happy with the mark they made on the final product. </p>\n<p id=\"GnDjcO\">The final report weighs in at over 100 pages, covering six key domestic policy areas: health care, the economy, climate change, criminal justice, education, and immigration.</p>\n<p id=\"d72iaZ\">Perhaps one of the most ambitious goals in the<strong> </strong>report, released Wednesday, is its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, plus<strong> </strong>more immediate benchmarks on climate — including a national goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030, and eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035. The report also advocates the creation of a postal banking system to expand banking access for low-income families, and a ban on for-profit charter schools. </p>\n<p id=\"VeOcuK\">Progressives see a list of ideas “that goes beyond a status quo and goes beyond where Biden had campaigned in the primary,” Faiz Shakir, Sanders’s presidential campaign manager in 2020 and an integral member in creating the task forces, told Vox. “If you look across all these documents, you’re going to see a massive public sector investment in job creation.”</p>\n<p id=\"Wpr9Uf\">Numerous people Vox interviewed said Biden’s thinking about how bold to be is being pushed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the resulting economic woes, and the national conversation around systemic racism in America. </p>\n<p id=\"6cVEWD\">The convergence of all three things has pushed Biden to adopt the mantle of New Deal President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in recent months. On Thursday, Biden will deliver a speech unveiling the first plank of his campaign’s economic plan — expected to be its policy centerpiece. </p>\n<p id=\"awuSSs\">“Much like FDR faced a structural crisis of economic insecurity, we’re at a similar place,” said Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economic adviser in the Obama White House and a member of the economy task force. “The vice president recognizes that the extent of market failure here is not something you can fix with a Band-Aid, and that structural reforms are necessary.”</p>\n<p id=\"5j7p3G\">Biden and Sanders each praised the report in a joint statement on Wednesday.</p>\n<p id=\"ZBoAwf\">“Though the end result is not what I or my supporters would have written alone, the task forces have created a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction and substantially improve the lives of working families throughout our country,” Sanders said.</p>\n<p id=\"YK1rTa\">Biden said that President Donald Trump’s current response to the still-raging coronavirus in America means that “this election offers the chance to usher in a stronger, fairer economy that works for our working families.”</p>\n<p id=\"T3WPjk\">“I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country,” Biden added. </p>\n<h3 id=\"HYnobx\">What’s in the task force report — and what’s next for the task force</h3>\n<p id=\"wCBg0d\">While it’s still unclear how many of these specific policy recommendations Biden’s campaign will adopt or work into their official policy, Democrats will know soon. The next concrete step for the task force report is for participants to advocate for it to be incorporated into the Democratic Party’s platform at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which starts on August 17. </p>\n<p id=\"9bKuXq\">But Sanders’s allies are clear that they don’t see the report as the final stop. They are lobbying Biden’s campaign to make sure any incoming transition team or administration contains a number of progressives.</p>\n<p id=\"DS2oEL\">“Phase two is continuing to shape and alter the Biden campaign’s positions,” Shakir told Vox. “We obviously are advocating for some of these members to be involved in transition planning. They send a symbolic message of what kind of administration are you trying to form. Here, you’ve got a progressive policy blueprint; now you need the progressive policy personnel to make it happen.”</p>\n<p id=\"h8ldI3\">Progressives told Vox they felt especially good about the wins they secured on two task forces: education and climate. On the economy task force, a big sticking point was a federal jobs guarantee program, which did not make it into the final list of recommendations (even though language saying the “government must enact measures to create jobs and jobs programs like those effectively used during the New Deal” did). </p>\n<p id=\"KBnnf9\">“Particularly on climate, I think we actually made far more progress than I think I even anticipated,” Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash, who served on the climate task force and was a Sanders pick, told Vox. “In large part, that was because many of the advisers on climate on Biden’s side were also equally amenable to ambitious action as many people on the Bernie side.”</p>\n<p id=\"qJmgNa\">On education, American Federation of Teachers president and task force member Randi Weingarten, a Biden pick, told Vox she thinks the task force recommendations could encourage Biden’s education plan to go much further than either the Trump or Obama administration did. </p>\n<p id=\"ST0SCQ\">“It’s a paradigm shift from the tearing down that you have right now with Trump and [Education Secretary Betsy] DeVos and their defunding, destabilizing, undermining philosophy,” Weingarten said. “But it’s also different than ‘accountability is the be-all, end-all’ of the Obama administration.”</p>\n<p id=\"IZbE6R\">While the Biden and Sanders teams may have started out in more agreement on climate, there was a clearly differing view on health care, with Sanders supporters in favor of Medicare-for-all and Biden’s campaign favoring a public option. And on issues like this — and criminal justice — the campaign didn’t move as far left. </p>\n<p id=\"2yw6ya\">“Though we have disagreements, I believe we’ve come together with something that reflects the average of where we stand and allows us to fight for a health care policy that would extend health care for millions of people,” said Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a single-payer advocate who was a Sanders pick for the health care task force. </p>\n<p id=\"d9QkyK\">“I feel they made a constructive contribution to that end,” said Chris Jennings, who was a health care policy adviser during the Obama administration and was a Biden pick for the health care task force. “I do believe the outcome is a stronger product and a more unified party.”</p>\n<p id=\"IzPaMA\">Here are some of the most notable policy recommendations it contains; the full report <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf\">can be read here</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"Dw3eRb\"><strong>Economy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"tCkN2i\">Broad public investment into infrastructure like America’s roads and bridges, in addition to retrofitting American homes and buildings to be more energy-efficient.
