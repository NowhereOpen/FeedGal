      "content:encoded": "\n<p>Yesterday I got an email asking how we achieve simple designs for Basecamp and HEY, so I hastily tweeted <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1280620028774305792?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a screenshot of my answer</a>, and a lot of people responded to it. A few folks pointed out that my screenshot was illegible for blind users, so I&#8217;m reposting it here in full text, with a bit of additional commentary below. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At a high level it boils down to a handful of foundational principles that affect the decisions we make:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Always choosing clarity over being slick or fancy. Internally we call this &#8220;Fisher Price&#8221; design. We aim to make the UI totally obvious and self explanatory, by keeping individual screens simple, showing only one focused thing at a time, and so on. Good product design eliminates the need for an instruction manual!</li><li>Preferring good copywriting, and taking the time and space to explain things with words, instead of making minimalist UIs with lots of unlabeled buttons, etc. (Although we&#8217;re still guilty of having a few of those.)</li><li>Prioritizing respectful interfaces that don&#8217;t overwhelm or try to nag the user into certain behaviors. We intentionally don&#8217;t include things like notification counts/badges, 3-column designs, and such unless we absolutely can&#8217;t avoid them. We don&#8217;t like the idea of having &#8220;sticky&#8221; interfaces—we want our customers to use our products to get the job done, and then go do something else. That makes the whole design approach more peaceful in general.</li><li>Having a strong editorial sensibility, and knowing when to split complex concepts into simpler individual parts. This one is more of an art than a science, but we have a good instinct for breaking down problems until they can be easily understood in simple UI flows.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one other thing that&#8217;s important for simple design. It&#8217;s not merely a matter of having clear or basic-looking interfaces. (It&#8217;s easy to make a simple UI that doesn&#8217;t really do much.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magic combo is having simple interfaces paired with powerful capabilities below the surface. HEY looks simple, and it&#8217;s straightforward to use, but it&#8217;s backed by some deeply considered opinions, logic, and machinery that empowers people who use it to be <em>better at email</em> than they were before—and with less effort! The interface itself is simple, but the thinking and the system behind it is extremely complex. The product is valuable because it saves people time and anxiety dealing with the terrible email mess that they had just learned to live with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on this line of thinking, we highly recommend Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/badass-making-users-awesome/9781491919019\">Badass: Making Users Awesome</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(P.S. many thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waynedixon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@waynedixon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redcrew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@redcrew</a> for calling me out on the inaccessible screenshot tweet.

It’s the toughest thing you’ll ever do as a product team. There are a million reasons why it won’t work, and zero guarantees that it will, so the whole project is a massive gamble. You just have to buckle up and trust that you’ll figure things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since HEY made a big splash on arrival, I thought it’d be fun to share the backstory of how we ended up reinventing email. Because we certainly didn’t <em>start</em> by wanting to reinvent email. (That sounds hard and intractable!)</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12736\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past several years, even pre-dating the work on HEY, we noticed some ongoing communications problems at our company. They all revolved around external email: things like going back and forth with lawyers, working with benefits providers, dealing with press outlets, accountants, and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was too hard to keep the right people in the loop, because we’d have lots of email threads scattered around with different participants, and none of them had the complete story. It was too hard to get caught up on a project that someone else was working on with a vendor. And too hard to hand work off when someone went on vacation or parental leave. At best, you&#8217;d end up with a steaming hot pile of forwarded emails, and it was all a chaotic mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was in total contrast to our well-tended internal communications, which all lives tidily in <a href=\"https://basecamp.com\">Basecamp</a> (the app), and suffers none of those problems. But Basecamp is mainly a company tool, and it’s not so reasonable to ask our miscellaneous vendors to join Basecamp just to communicate with us. So what’s the equivalent of Basecamp for the outside world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t exist! So we began thinking about how we might solve these problems with a new product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, we were considering making a successor to our older CRM product, <a class=\"yoast-seo-link\" href=\"https://highrisehq.com\">Highrise</a>. Highrise was our first take on the external communications world, but it doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough to cover all the scenarios we wanted to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And thus, HEY started its life as a prototype for a possible Highrise 2.</strong> It was originally focused around work problems—not personal email problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In May of 2018, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jason</a> and I kicked off the first work on a prototype, built in <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jekyll</a>, which was code-named <strong>Haystack</strong>. We were intent on addressing real-life situations right away, so I asked our Head of People Ops, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/alarowe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Andrea</a>, to find the gnarliest vendor email threads she’d been involved with recently. She forwarded all the emails to me, along with any internal chats she had <em>about</em> those emails. Using that source material, I painstakingly reconstructed all the conversations into seed data for our prototype. That way we’d have some real stuff to judge our ideas against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started by designing how these internal/external threads might look and work, then gradually worked our way out to the Inbox view, and finally filled in various supplemental ideas around the edges. We focused specifically on email pain points, and discarded any notion of how email &#8220;usually works&#8221; in favor of the way we would ideally want it to work, while also considering what we could realistically foresee building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few months of prototyping, it looked like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul

Prototype</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Having explored lots of different examples and core ideas (including the nascent version of <a href=\"https://hey.com/features/the-screener/\">The Screener</a>, the <a href=\"https://hey.com/features/all-files/\">All Files view</a>, and contact pages), we felt like we had something promising. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of it really worked, there were still a million unknowns, and loads of features we hadn&#8217;t figured out yet, but there was one thing we were sure about—it had evolved far beyond just a better Highrise. If we were going to build it, it needed to become a complete email service. And if it was going to be an email service, it needed to have a personal version, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Building it</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By early 2019 we started the process of making HEY real. At first we used the prototype&#8217;s general skeleton as a foundation to start wiring things up, but we continued to hone the app&#8217;s visual design. Our brilliant marketing designer <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamStddrd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adam</a> joined up, and he helped us shed all the experimental cruft from the original design, paring things back and making the whole thing more minimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam also developed the original color palettes and menu gradients that became iconic—those bright pops of color are sprinkled throughout and give the app a lot of friendly personality without being too overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

minimalism</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Tightening up, adding features, and doing all the hard work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing with a team where everyone has autonomy is a bit like playing in a band. Someone seeds an idea, and then someone else builds on it and takes it somewhere else, then those changes get promoted into little systems, and over time the best ideas persist through all the changes. Harmonies prevail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that taking place in the screenshots above, but it really picked up steam from mid-2019 on, when the whole the company started working in earnest. For a while there was a lot of tug-of-war design and development between the web and mobile teams, where all of us bent and stretched the system for what we needed on our respective platforms. Since HEY is a hybrid web app, we ended up building a ton of new tech to optimize for UI patterns that would work equally well on a phone or a laptop (we&#8217;ll be sharing a lot more about that soon.) <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/conormuirhead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Conor</a> led the way on a lot of those efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By early 2020 we had worked out most of the fundamentals. We had Reply Later and Set Aside, and we had The Feed, which at that time was called &#8220;Slowbox&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul

It’s on us to reverse course as quickly as possible to stay below the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tipping point of 1.5℃</a> global warming. Without action, the future is beyond bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At Basecamp, we’re committing to becoming carbon negative for our cumulative history and moving forward.<br><br></strong>The first step of that commitment is understanding the size of our carbon footprint. We’ve just completed our first carbon footprinting exercise as a company and are publishing our results. By sharing our approach, we hope to make it easier for other companies to also join the collective mission to carbon negativity. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12784\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In 2019, Basecamp’s estimated carbon footprint was ~820 t</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/27/co2e-global-warming-potential\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>CO2e</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Here’s how that breaks down:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏘  <strong>Remote offices: ~5 tCO2e</strong><br>Basecamp is a remote company which means even in the pre-COVID era, we mostly <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-working-the-home-office-desks-of-basecamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">work from home</a>. The power drawn to run our work computers and monitors are attributable to Basecamp. We roughly estimated power drawn for 50 Basecampers whose homes are not powered by renewable energy, a laptop + monitor/person for 40 hours/week/Basecamper, 47 work weeks/year, and a CO2e/kWH emissions factor from the US electricity supply average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🛌  <strong>Event lodging and meals: ~20 tCO2e<br></strong>As a company, we typically hold two in-person gatherings a year. We also occasionally travel to attend conferences for professional development or train new team members. The majority of the non-transportation emissions from these gatherings are tied to hotel stays, using emission factors from the <a href=\"https://www.hotelfootprints.org/footprinting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cornell Hotel Sustainability Benchmarking Index</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💻  <strong>Hardware manufacturing + end-of-life: ~25 tCO2e<br></strong>There are emissions associated with the production and disposal of each laptop, monitor, on-prem server, etc. we use as a company. Those emissions can be prorated by the hardware’s expected lifespan for each year. Several manufacturers helpfully publish their own carbon footprint estimates for their devices so we used those specs to calculate the emissions associated with 56 laptops and monitors and 55 on-prem databases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✈️  <strong>Transportation: ~75 tCO2e<br></strong>Basecampers flew nearly 400k miles (644k km) and traveled roughly 35k miles (56k km) over ground combined in 2019 for meetups, conferences, and trainings. Those travels translate into roughly 63 tCO2e for flights and 12 tCO2e for ground transport based on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-01/documents/egrid2018_summary_tables.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EPA emissions data</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🗄 On-prem hosting: ~80 tCO2e<br></strong>We run several of our applications in on-prem data centers. It takes energy to host the apps, to the tune of roughly 330,000 kWH in 2019. One of our on-prem data centers is powered via an emission-free energy supply contract. After excluding the power from that data center, we translated the power consumption from our remaining on-prem data servers using emissions factors from the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Energy Information Administration</a> and global warming potentials from the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏢 <strong> Company office: ~120 tCO2e<br></strong>For the last ten years, Basecamp has <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/about/office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">had a headquarters office</a> in Chicago. It’s a beautiful space that was the gathering grounds for our company meetups. Turns out, that office is also heated by electricity and we used a whopping 261,130 kWH in 2019. In Illinois, 60% of power is generated from fossil fuels so that consumption translates into more emissions than all of our company transportation in 2019. This realization was one of the most shocking findings from our carbon footprint. We’re <a href=\"https://rework.fm/office-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">saying goodbye to the office in July</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>📚  <strong>Printed books: ~135 tCO2e<br></strong>Basecamp’s founders have written several <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books</a> including <em>REMOTE</em>, <em>REWORK</em>, and <em>It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work</em>. Approximately 45k copies sold in 2019 combined. Using a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00414.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">benchmark</a> of 3 kg CO2e/book puts the footprint of these books in the same ballpark as the company office emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>☁️  Cloud hosting (including data transfers and storage): ~285 tCO2e<br></strong>We also use Amazon Web Services to run our apps, with a few supporting infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud data centers use a lot of electricity, though there are efficiencies gained by scale. However, not all cloud services are equal from a climate change perspective. Since 2017, GCP has <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">added enough additional renewable energy</a>sources to the grids its data centers are on to be considered carbon neutral. AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can’t say the same thing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough to estimate the carbon footprint of AWS service usage as they do not share power consumption as a metric. So to estimate, we broke down data we do have — server hours used, GB data transferred, and GB stored — and converted to energy consumed and carbon emissions from there. We assumed a 30% discount in power usage for AWS’ servers, based on their own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/e3/79/42bf75c94c279c67d777f002051f/carbon-reduction-opportunity-of-moving-to-aws.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commissioned report</a>&nbsp;on how much savings typically comes from facility efficiency and renewable energy usage. We then used an extrapolated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/13688293/uploads/2691570270\">research estimate</a>&nbsp;of kWh/GB used to transfer data over the Internet. Overall, this method led to an estimated 580,000 kWH for cloud compute, 633,000 kWH for data transfer, and 140,000 kWH for data storage in regions that aren’t fully carbon offset in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of uncertainty in this estimate, in both directions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On one hand, AWS could merit a higher discount on emissions. Their current stated goal is to get to 100% energy offset by 2030 and a significant portion of the renewable energy projects they have invested in appear to be going into the grids that power our apps. We just don’t know for sure and so erred on the environmentally conservative side.</li><li>On the other hand, the extrapolated energy intensity we used for data transfer emissions could have been too generous. If there are any informed experts on the carbon footprint of data transfer out there, we’d love to learn from your work.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🐛  Wiggle room: 75 tCO2e<br></strong>Since this is our first time doing a carbon footprinting, we assume we’ve missed something decently substantial. For instance, we have not gone through to footprint the upstream indirect emissions from other software vendors, many of which are also hosted on AWS. In an attempt to account for these unknowns, this wiggle room category is an additional 10% of associated emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So in total, this puts us at ~820 tCO2e for 2019. </strong>We’ve also projected a footprint of ~770 tCO2e for 2020 and estimated a very rough historical cumulative carbon footprint of 6,000 tCO2e for 1999-2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s one more unaccounted for unknown worth mentioning:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💰  <strong>Banking: ??? tCO2e<br></strong>Money makes the world run and we’re cognizant that our banking partner could easily be the largest source of indirect emissions. In the course of our research, we found a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/financing_global_warming_(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2008 report from the Rainforest Action Network</a> that was very eye-opening on the potential footprint. We’re looking for more recent research or data that could help us factor in the indirect emissions from our deposit accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next few weeks, Basecamp will purchase enough certified carbon credits to offset our estimated cumulative carbon footprint and make us carbon neutral. To get to carbon negative, we further invest at least a further $100,000 each year starting this year (2020) to sponsor new carbon offsetting projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also place even more emphasis internally on the&nbsp;<em>reduction&nbsp;</em>of our own emissions: through our choice of vendors, our company events, and our software design. The environmental benefit of not emitting is more certain and immediate than the eventual carbon sequestration from reforestation projects and emerging technologies. We can emit less and we’re going to do the work to do so.</p>\n",

      "content:encoded": "\n<p>Since we started working on HEY, one of the things that I&#8217;ve been a big proponent of was keeping as much of the app-side compute infrastructure on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/\">spot instances</a> as possible (front-end and async job processing; excluding the database, Redis, and Elasticsearch). Coming out of our first two weeks running the app with a real production traffic load, we&#8217;re sitting at ~90% of our compute running on spot instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially around the launch of a new product, you typically don&#8217;t know what traffic and load levels are going to look like, making purchases of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/\">reserved instances</a> or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/\">savings plans</a> a risky proposition. Spot instances give us the ability to get the compute we need at an even deeper discount than a 1-year RI or savings plan rate would, without the same commitment. Combine the price with seamless integration with auto-scaling groups and it makes them a no-brainer for most of our workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>The big catch with spot instances? AWS can take them back from you with a two-minute notice.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12742\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spot-appropriate workloads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opting to run the bulk of your workloads on spot only works well if those workloads can handle being torn down and recreated with ease (in our case, via Kubernetes pods). What does &#8220;with ease&#8221; mean though? For us it means without causing exceptions (either customer-facing or internally) or job failures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For HEY, we are able to get away with running the entire front-end stack (<a href=\"https://openresty.org/en/\">OpenResty</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/puma/puma\">Puma</a>) and the bulk of our async background jobs (<a href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a>) on spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enduring workloads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What doesn&#8217;t fit well on spot instances? For HEY, we&#8217;ve found three main categories: long-running jobs, Redis instances for <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/\">branch deploys</a>, and anything requiring a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/\">persistent volume</a> (like certain pieces of the mail pipeline). We put these special cases on what we refer to as the &#8220;enduring&#8221; nodegroup that uses regular, on-demand instances (and probably RIs or savings plans in the future).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jobs that have the possibility of running for more than a minute-and-a-half to two-minutes are an automatic push over to the enduring node-group. Currently for HEY this is just <a href=\"https://hey.com/faqs/#if-i-don-t-like-hey-can-i-export-my-email-and-contacts\">account exports</a>.</li><li>Redis is a primary infrastructure component for HEY. We use it for a bunch of things &#8212; view caching, Resque, inbound mail pipeline info storage, etc. HEY has a dynamic branch deploy system that deploys any branch in GitHub to a unique hostname, with each of those branch deploys needing their own Redis instances so that they don&#8217;t step on each other (using the Redis databases feature doesn&#8217;t quite work here). For a while we tried running these Redis instances on spot, but ugh, the monitoring noise and random breakage from Redis pods coming and going and then the app connecting to the read-only pod and throwing exceptions&#8230;. it was too much. The fix: get them off of spot instances. <em>[this only affects beta/staging &#8212; those environments use a vendored Redis Helm chart that we run in the cluster, production uses Elasticache]</em></li><li>We&#8217;ve successfully run lots of things that require PVCs in Kubernetes. Heck, for several months we ran the entire Elasticsearch clusters for Basecamp 2 and 3 on Kubernetes without any major issues. <em>But</em> that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;d recommend it, and I especially do not recommend it when using spot instances. One recurring issue we saw was that a node with a pod using a PVC would get reclaimed and that pod would not have a node to launch on in the same AZ as the existing PVC. Kubernetes <s>absolutely loves this</s> shows this via a volume affinity error and it frequently required manual clean-up to get the pods launching again. Rolling the dice on having to intervene whenever a spot reclamation happens it not worth it to our team.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting it right</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>node-termination-handler</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably the most important piece of the spot-with-Kubernetes puzzle is <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler\">aws-node-termination-handler</a>. It runs as a DaemonSet and continuously watches the EC2 metadata service to see if the current node has been issued any spot termination notifications (or scheduled maintenance notifications). If one is found, it&#8217;ll (attempt to) gracefully remove the running pods so that Kubernetes can schedule them elsewhere with no user impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> cluster-autoscaler</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler\">cluster-autoscaler</a> doesn&#8217;t need many changes to run with a spot auto-scaling group. Since we&#8217;re talking about ensuring that instance termination behaviors are handled appropriately though, you should know about the pain we went through to get ASG rebalancing handled properly. When rebalancing, we&#8217;d see nodes that just died and the ALB would continue to send traffic to them via kube-proxy because there was no warning to kubelet that they were about to go away. aws-node-termination-handler <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler/issues/95\">cannot handle rebalancing</a> currently, but I believe that <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html\">EKS managed nodegroups</a> do &#8212; at the expense of not supporting spot instances. A project called <a href=\"https://github.com/keikoproj/lifecycle-manager\">lifecycle-manager</a> proved to be critical for us in handling rebalancing with ease (even though we ended up just disabling rebalancing all together 😬).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Instance types and sizes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s wise to do your own testing and determine how your workloads consume CPU and memory resources and choose your EC2 instance types and sizes accordingly. Spot ASGs are most valuable when the ASG scheduler can pick from many different instance types and sizes to fill your spot requests. Without spreading that load across many types (or sizes), you run the risk of being impacted by capacity events where AWS cannot fulfill your spot request. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, we had this happen to us earlier in the year when spot demand skyrocketed. We ran into issues with the ASG telling us there was no spot capacity to fulfill our request, and when things were fulfilled, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon for those instances to be reclaimed just a few minutes later. The churn was untenable at that rate. The fix for us was to run with other instance types and sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our workloads perform best with C-series instances, we know this, so that&#8217;s what we use. However, if you can get away with using M or T-series instances, do it (they have comparable CPU/memory requests across the size range and you easily pull from m5, m5d, m5n, etc. to add more variability to your spot requests).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A gotcha:</em> cluster-autoscaler really does not like mixed-instance ASGs where the CPU and memory requests are not the same across the available node types. It can leave you in a position where it thinks the ASG has 8c/16g nodes while the ASG actually fulfilled a request using a 4c/8g node &#8212; now cluster-autoscaler&#8217;s math on how many instances it needs for the set of unschedulable pods is incorrect. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md#using-autoscalinggroup-mixedinstancespolicy\">a section on this</a> in the cluster-autoscaler documentation, but the tl;dr is that if you want to use different instance types, make sure the specs are generally the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Availability zones and regions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot instance availability and price varies a ton across availability zones and regions.

If you&#8217;re scheduling only in us1-az2, you&#8217;re paying an 18% premium over us1-az1. If your ASG is setup to span AZs, this is automatically taken into account when fulfilling spot requests and AWS will try to place your instances in cheaper AZs if possible (unless you&#8217;ve changed the scheduling priority option).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just availability zones where there are real price disparities. Among different regions, the price differences can be even stronger. Take us-east-1 and us-east-2 &#8212; two regions where the prices of compute are typically the same for on-demand reservations. In us-east-2, spot requests for c5.2xlarge instances are currently going for between 40-50% cheaper than the same thing in us-east-1:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12746\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/running-spot-instances-effectively-with-amazon-eks/image-4-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=1564%2C1008&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1564,1008\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=600%2C387&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=640%2C412&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12746\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=1564&amp;ssl=1 1564w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=600%2C387&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=1536%2C990&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>c5.2xlarge, us-east-2 &#8212; courtesy of spotcost.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a significant savings at scale. Of course there are other obligations for running in other regions &#8212; are all of the services you use supported, can you reach other infrastructure you may have, etc. (and it&#8217;s also possible that moving to another region for price alone just doesn&#8217;t make sense for you, that&#8217;s totally fine!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leveling up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Merely running compute on spot isn&#8217;t the end-goal though, and there are several paths that we can take to continue to level-up our compute infrastructure to place resources optimally, both from a cost standpoint and for keeping things close to the end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>[shorter term] <strong>Using the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/\">Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> to automatically scale <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">deployment</a> replica counts as traffic to the platform regularly ebbs and flows.</strong> When combined with cluster-autoscaler, Kubernetes (with a lot of trust from your ops team&#8230;..) can take care of scaling your infrastructure automatically based on CPU utilization, request latency, request count, etc. HEY is already starting to show a standard traffic pattern where usage is highest during the US work hours and then drops greatly overnight and on the weekends. These are perfect times to scale the app down to a smaller deployment size. Front-end compute isn&#8217;t the biggest cost driver for HEY (that falls to persistent data storage infrastructure like Aurora and Elasticache), but scaling <em>something</em> down when you can is better than not scaling anything at all.</li><li>[long term] <strong>Shunting compute between regions and AZs based on spot pricing.</strong> This is likely to not be something that a company the size of Basecamp ever needs to think about, but being able to shunt traffic around to different regions and AZs based on compute cost and availability is a dream stretch goal. This is tricky because we also need to take into account where our data backends live. Maybe you&#8217;re already running an active/active/active setup with three regions around the world and can gradually shift your scaling operations around the different regions as different parts of the world start to wake-up and use your app. Maybe you&#8217;re just using a simpler active/active setup, but compute prices or availability in region A start to show signs of trouble, you can easily move over to region B.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot instances can be a great tool for managing spend while getting the compute resources you need, but they come with additional challenges that you must remain aware of. Going down this path isn&#8217;t a one-time decision &#8212; especially with an app that is seeing active development, you have to be mindful of changing resource utilization and workflows to ensure that spot terminations don&#8217;t cause harm to your workloads and customers, and that changes in core spot features (like pricing and availability) don&#8217;t impact you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that if spot does turn out to be a negative for you, moving to on-demand is a single change to your auto-scaling group config and then gradually relaunching your existing instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in HEY, checkout <a href=\"https://hey.com\">hey.com</a> and learn about our take on email. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Blake is Senior System Administrator on Basecamp’s Operations team who spends most of his time working with Kubernetes, and AWS, in some capacity.

      "content:encoded": "\n<p>We recently deleted over three million accounts across all our apps. This was the answer to a question we asked ourselves last year: what should we do about &nbsp;accounts that weren’t cancelled, but weren’t used either? Should we keep hold of their data forever?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That felt wrong &#8211; we promise to delete data when you cancel your account. Keeping so much data around felt like we weren&#8217;t living up to that promise, and felt like a liability, so we decided to do something about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12656\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>We planned to target three groups of accounts, representing 3.2 million across six apps: Campfire, Backpack, Highrise, and the Basecamps (Classic, 2 and 3):</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Paid accounts who stopped payments</li><li>Old trial accounts that never upgraded to a paid account</li><li>Free accounts that haven’t been active in over a year</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We organized the project in stages, each focused on a specific group of accounts. We implemented two actions for each:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A big initial deletion of accounts</li><li>An automatic cancellation workflow to keep the system self-maintained moving forward.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial cancellation of accounts, we had a thorough discussion about whether we should notify them all. We had accounts dating back to 2004, and with the number of accounts we were talking about, even a small percentage of replies would represent a significant extra workload for our support team. Also we worried about former customers thinking we were spamming them. How could we do the right thing, in a manageable way? We decided on some thresholds to try and find the right balance. For example, we decided to cancel without notifying accounts that had been inaccessible for not paying for three years or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then a customer wrote in about his old account (from 2004!). He had stopped paying in 2015 and hadn&#8217;t accessed their account since then. And now, almost 5 years later, they wanted to reopen it. When they wrote us, they were beyond the 30-days limit we wait between cancellation and actual data incineration, so despite trying hard, we couldn&#8217;t recover their data. They were gracious and understanding, but it was heartbreaking. We decided to change course: we would notify everyone instead. We talked about this in detail <a href=\"https://rework.fm/delete-your-account/\">in this episode of Rework</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending millions of emails made us work hard on making them as self-serving as possible, for our customers, and for our support team. We refined, measured, and refined again in a process that saw us deliver 200 emails per day in December to 28,000 per day when we finished in April. For example, these are the initial and final versions we used for notifying free inactive accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<div

      "content:encoded": "\n<p>We’ve been teaching people how to do remote work well for the better part of two decades. We wrote a whole book about the topic in 2013, called <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/remote\">REMOTE: Office Not Required</a>. Basecamp has been a remote company since day one, and our software is sold as an all-in-one toolkit for remote work. Yeah, we’re big on remote work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that COVID-19 has forced a lot of companies to move to remote work, it’s doubly important that we do our part to help those new to the practice settle in. We’ve been hosting a variety of online seminars, done podcasts, and been advocating for healthy ways to do remote right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the move to remote work has also turbo-charged interest in employee surveillance software. Drew Harwell’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/30/work-from-home-surveillance/\">harrowing report</a> for The Washington Post should make anyone’s skin crawl, but it seems some managers are reading about these disgusting tools and thinking “oh, what a great idea, where can I buy?”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as fate would have it, some of those managers would then visit these employee surveillance vendors and see a Basecamp logo! 😱 These vendors promoting their wares by featuring integrations with Basecamp, usually under the banner of “time tracking”. Yikes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve decided it’s our obligation to resist the normalization of employee surveillance software. It is not right, it is not human, and unless we speak up now, we might well contribute to this cancer of mistrust and control spreading even after the COVID-19 crisis is behind us. That is not something we in good conscience could let happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12632\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>So we’ve changed our policy governing the privilege to integrate with Basecamp, and the rules stipulating how our logo can be used to promote such integrations. As with all our policy work, it’s done in public. Here’s <a href=\"https://github.com/basecamp/policies/pull/40\">the pull request</a>, and here are the key passages: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user&#8217;s activity other <em>than time tracking</em>, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“You must request permission to use the Company&#8217;s logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please email us requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, we’ve moved to ban employee surveillance vendors from integrating with Basecamp, and to use Basecamp’s logo under any circumstances. We’ve already reached out to all the vendors that we’ve deemed to be in violation of these terms, and given them notice and a deadline to halt the integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, employers are always free to – and should! &#8211; evaluate the work product produced by employees. But they don&#8217;t have to surveil someone&#8217;s every move or screenshot their computer every five minutes to do so. That&#8217;s monitoring the inputs. Monitor the outputs instead, and you&#8217;ll have a much healthier, saner relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you hire smart, capable people and trust them to do good work – surprise-surprise – people will return the sentiment deliver just that! The irony of setting up these invasive surveillance regimes is that they end up causing the motivation to goof off to beat the very systems that were setup to catch such behavior. It&#8217;s Hawthorne&#8217;s Effect on steroids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every manager should be capable of evaluating the work itself. If the work starts slipping, they should investigate why. Maybe an employee is dealing with a personal situation, maybe they&#8217;re just stuck, and didn&#8217;t ask for help. There are a million reasons more likely than &#8220;employee wanted to defraud their employer&#8221; when the work isn&#8217;t where it needs to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But either way, the end result is the same. People are employed to do good work. If they stop doing good work for a long period of time, and, after several interventions, aren&#8217;t able to turn that around, well, they’ll quite likely not be able to secure their employment any longer. No surveillance is necessary to make that determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just say no to employee surveillance.</p>\n",

      "content:encoded": "\n<p>There’s no perfect process for hiring great programmers, but there are plenty of terrible ways to screw it up. We’ve rejected the industry stables of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/834146806594433025\">grilling candidates in front of a whiteboard</a> or <a href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3071-why-we-dont-hire-programmers-based-on-puzzles-api-quizzes-math-riddles-or-other-parlor-tricks\">needling them with brain teasers</a> since the start at <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>. But you’re not getting around showing real code when applying for a job here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early days of the company, we hired programmers almost exclusively from the open source community. I simply tapped people I’d been working with on the <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and I knew that their code would be good, because I’d seen so much of it! This is how we hired Jamis, Jeremy, Sam, Josh, Pratik, Matthew, and Eileen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you only consider candidates from the open source community, you’re going to miss out on plenty of great programmers who just don’t have the time or the inclination to contribute code to open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unfortunately, it’s rarely an option for candidates to submit code from a previous job with an application to a new job. Unlike design, which is at least somewhat out in the open, commercial code is often closely guarded. And even if it wasn’t, it’s often hard to tease out what someone was actually personally responsible for (which can also be a challenge with design!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we’ve started to do instead at Basecamp is level the playing field by asking late-stage candidates to complete a small programming assignment as part of the final evaluation process. I’m going to show you two examples of these projects, and the submissions from the candidates that ended up being hired.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12626\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>But first it’s important to recognize that we don’t ask applicants to do these assessments as part of their initial application. We simply get way too many applications for most openings to make that practical or fair. <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-front-end-programmer/\">The last opening on the Research &amp; Fidelity team</a> got over 1,300 applications. Nobody can review that many code submissions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we whittle the group of candidates down aggressively first. This means judging their cover letter and, to a far lesser extent, their resume. For the opening we had on the Research &amp; Fidelity team, we gave 40 people the take-home test, and even that proved to be too many. For <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-senior-programmer/\">the opening we had on the Security, Infrastructure &amp; Performance team</a>, we only gave 13 people the take-home test. That felt better. In the future, we’ll target fewer than 20 for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the assessment itself. I’ve heard many fair complaints that companies are asking candidates to complete massive projects that may take 20-30-40 hours of work, which is all unpaid, and which might be difficult for candidates to fit in with their existing job and life. Yeah, don’t do that. Asking someone for forty hours of work product, without pay, which might well go nowhere, is not what we do or advocate at Basecamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the design side, we have asked candidates to complete more substantial projects, perhaps asking 10-20 hours of work, but then we pay them for the work. It’s like getting hired for a small freelance gig, even if you don’t get the job, and even if we’re never going to use the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for programmers, we don’t need a project that large to get a good indication of someone’s programming skills or thought process. With both of the last two openings, we used assignment that were estimated to take 3-5 hours to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s still a very substantial commitment! I wouldn’t ask anyone to submit such unpaid work without believing they were clearly in the running for the position. But when you look at our numbers, we usually don’t end up asking more than 1-3% of our applicants for such a commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s worth contrasting that against the work we’re not asking people to do. We don’t run candidates through some recruiter mill, where they have to do phone screening after phone screening. We don’t use any sort of automated tooling to scan resumes or whatever. We don’t even have people travel for interviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On our side, we often spend <em>weeks</em> perfecting the job opening itself. We put in an absolutely tremendous amount of work to conduct a fair, human, respectful, and thorough job search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the rules of the game are specified up front. You shouldn’t apply to a programming job at Basecamp unless you’re prepared to put in the work writing a considered, tailored cover letter, and then making the 3-5+ hours available to complete the programming assessment, if you make it into that top group of 1-3% of applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The SIP assignment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, let’s take a look at these take-home assignments. The first is from our Security, Infrastructure &amp; Performance team, and it was designed by Rosa. This was for a senior programmer opening. 13 applicants were asked to complete the assignment, and they were given a full week to do it (such that the estimated 3-5 hours could be spread out over several week nights or maybe the weekend).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It focused on a sliver of a real problem we’d been dealing with at Basecamp: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rosa/783d23a4a835b9a81ea7e8cec5eaf671\">Support for ban in rack-ratelimit</a>. So it wasn’t some Tower of Hanoi abstract, computer-sciency test that you can look up a million solutions to, and which favor recent grads of CS algorithm courses. No, it was for implementing a feature in the same way you might well be asked to do on the job. There was a clear example of the API we wanted, and then candidates could solve it as they saw fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorge Manrubia, who we ended up hiring, submitted his solution as a <a href=\"https://github.com/jorgemanrubia/rack-ratelimit/pull/1\">full pull request</a> –– complete with system tests and performance tests and documentation! It was a very comprehensive solution, but almost to a fault. I remember one of my concerns with Jorge’s submission was that it was borderline gold plated. We had several other submissions that were also wonderful, but far smaller, which could just as well had made for the final choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorge admitted to spending closer to 7-8 hours, in total, on his submission. We never policed this, because it really wasn’t a material part of the assessment. The solution would have been as compelling without all the extracurriculars, and several other candidates shone just as brightly with more modest submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which goes to a second point: Completing a programming assignment is required <em>but insufficient</em> to land a job at Basecamp. You can’t get hired without demonstrating a core competency in writing great code, but you also won’t get hired just because you can write great code alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programming assessment simply unlocks the next step of the evaluation process. Out of the 13 candidates that received the programming assignment, 10 progressed to a first phone interview with Andrea (our head of people ops), then 6 progressed to interviews with the whole team, and finally 2 candidates got an extra interview to determine who we were going to hire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The R&amp;F assignment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-front-end-programmer/\">the programmer opening on our Research &amp; Fidelity team</a>, we followed a very similar process, but made the mistake of giving the programming assignment to too many people –– 40 in total. As discussed earlier, we should, and will in the future, cap that to 20 max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This assignment was designed by Javan, and focused on another real-life sliver of the work we were doing on HEY: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/javan/b3205fa057341f09d97710d7941107a7\">Enhance datalist autocomplete</a>. The challenge came complete with the basic HTML form, and then directions on how to use JavaScript to enhance it to get us the universal autocomplete across the three major browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nabeelah Ali, who we ended up hiring here, submitted <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/nali/69d374d403e95276149d9511ac54827e\">her solution</a> with fewer flourishes than Jorge, but code no less impressive. Everything contained in a single page to make the solution work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Jorge, Nabeelah also ended up spending more than the estimated 3-5 hours to complete the assignment. Somewhere around double there too. Much of that spent refactoring and polishing the solution. As a new mother with a 10-month old, just being back to work, and dealing with nightly wake-ups, this definitely wasn’t easy. But, as she said, “I would do that any day over a doing a live coding challenge”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which goes to the point that the alternative to a take-home programming assignment is rarely “nothing”. It’s often spending as much time, or more, traveling for a day of packed interviews. Some times traveling more than once! Dealing with the whiteboard assessments. Or going through abstract programming games or assessments that aren’t reflective of the work the team actually does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are of course other alternatives too. Some do half a day of pair programming together with candidates. Others ask for a code review, where the candidate comments on existing code. To me, the former often relies on an in-person meeting to work well (and that wasn’t going to happen, with Jorge hired from Spain, and Nabeelah hired from Norway), and the latter isn’t someone’s own code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring is hard. Applying is hard. Doing either with programmers without looking at actual code they wrote often risks leading down a path of bias (or, as we call it today, &#8220;fit&#8221;), credentialism, whiteboard puzzles, and brainteasers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll stick with the hard work.</p>\n",

For our other applications like <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp 3</a>, we make this happen via a series of numbered environments called betas (beta1 through betaX). A beta environment is essentially a mini production environment &#8212; it uses the production database but everything else (app services, Resque, Redis) is separate. In Basecamp 3&#8217;s case, we have a claim system via an internal chatbot that shows the status of each beta environment (here, none of them are claimed): </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12578\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/image-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?fit=1672%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1672,514\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?fit=600%2C184&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?fit=640%2C197&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12578\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?w=1672&amp;ssl=1 1672w, https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?resize=600%2C184&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?resize=768%2C236&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?resize=1536%2C472&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption><em>(prior to starting work on HEY, we were running 8 beta environments for BC3)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our existing beta setup is fine, but what if we can do something better with the new capabilities that we are afforded by relying on Kubernetes? Indeed we can! After reading about <a href=\"https://github.blog/2015-06-02-deploying-branches-to-github-com/\">GitHub&#8217;s branch-lab setup</a>, I was inspired to come up with a better solution for beta environments than our existing claims system. The result is what&#8217;s in-use today for HEY: <strong>a system that (almost) immediately deploys any branch to a branch-specific endpoint that you can access right away to test your changes without having to use the claims system or talk to anyone else </strong>(along with an independent job processing fleet and Redis instance to support the environment).</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12575\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let&#8217;s walk through the developer workflow</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A dev is working on a feature addition to the app, aptly named <strong>new-feature</strong>.</li><li>They make their changes in a branch (called new-feature) and push them to GitHub which automatically triggers a CI run in <a href=\"https://buildkite.com/\">Buildkite</a>:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12581\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/image-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?fit=2284%2C242&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2284,242\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?fit=600%2C64&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?fit=640%2C68&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?fit=640%2C68&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12581\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?w=2284&amp;ssl=1 2284w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=600%2C64&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=1800%2C191&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=768%2C81&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=1536%2C163&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?resize=2048%2C217&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-1.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The first step in the CI pipeline builds the base Docker image for the app (all later steps depend on it). If the dev hasn&#8217;t made a change to Gemfile/Gemfile.lock, this step takes ~8 seconds. Once that&#8217;s complete, it&#8217;s off to the races for the remaining steps, but most importantly for this blog post: <strong>Beta Deploy.</strong></li><li>The &#8220;Beta Deploy&#8221; step runs <code>bin/deploy</code> within the built base image, creating a POST to <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/\">GitHub&#8217;s Deployments API</a>. In the repository settings for our app, we&#8217;ve configured a webhook that responds solely to deployment events &#8212; it&#8217;s connected to a separate Buildkite pipeline. When GitHub receives a new deployment request, it sends a webhook over to Buildkite causing another build to be queued that handles the actual deploy (known as the deploy build).</li><li>The &#8220;deploy build&#8221; is responsible for building the remainder of the images needed to run the app (nginx, etc.) and actually carrying out the Helm upgrades to both the main app chart and the accompanying Redis chart (that supports Resque and other Redis needs of the branch deploy):</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12598\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/image-3-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?fit=2284%2C330&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2284,330\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?fit=600%2C87&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?fit=640%2C92&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?fit=640%2C92&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12598\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?w=2284&amp;ssl=1 2284w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=600%2C87&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=1800%2C260&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=768%2C111&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=1536%2C222&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?resize=2048%2C296&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-3.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>From there, Kubernetes starts creating the deployments, statefulsets, services, and ingresses needed for the branch, a minute or two later <strong>the developer can access their beta at https://new-feature.corp.com</strong>.

No problem, the same <code>bin/deploy</code> script that&#8217;s used in CI works just fine locally:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ bin/deploy beta\n&#91;✔] Queueing deploy\n&#91;✔] Waiting for the deploy build to complete : https://buildkite.com/new-company/great-new-app-deploys/builds/13819\n&#91;✔] Kubernetes deploy complete, waiting for Pumas to restart\n\nDeploy success! App URL: https://new-feature.corp.com</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(<code>bin/deploy</code> also takes care of verifying that the base image has already been built for the commit being deployed. If it hasn&#8217;t it&#8217;ll wait for the initial CI build to make it past that step before continuing on to queueing the deploy.)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remove the blanket!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sweet, so the developer workflow is easy enough, but there&#8217;s got to be more going on below the covers, right? Yes, a lot. But first, story time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HEY runs on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">Amazon EKS</a> &#8212; AWS&#8217; managed Kubernetes product. While we wanted to use Kubernetes, we don&#8217;t have enough bandwidth on the operations team to deal with running a bare-metal Kubernetes setup currently (or relying on something like Kops on AWS), so we&#8217;re more than happy to pay AWS a few dollars per month to handle managing our cluster masters for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While EKS is a managed service and relatively integrated with AWS, you still need a few other pieces installed to do things like create Application Load Balancers (what we use for the front-end of HEY) and touch Route53. For those two pieces, we have a reliance on the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller\">aws-alb-ingress-controller</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns\">external-dns</a> projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the app Helm chart we have two <code>Ingress</code> resources (one external, and one internal for cross-region traffic that stays within the AWS network) that have all of the right annotations to tell alb-ingress-controller to spin up an ALB with the proper settings (health-checks so that instances are marked healthy/unhealthy, HTTP→HTTPS redirection at the load balancer level, and the proper SSL certificate from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/\">AWS Certificate Manager</a>) and also to let external-dns know that we need some DNS records created for this new ALB.  Those annotations look something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Annotations:\n  kubernetes.io/ingress.class:                             alb\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports:                  &#91;{\"HTTP\": 80},{\"HTTPS\": 443}]\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme:                        internet-facing\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy:                    ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect:          {\"Type\": \"redirect\", \"RedirectConfig\": { \"Protocol\": \"HTTPS\", \"Port\": \"443\", \"StatusCode\": \"HTTP_301\"}}\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn:               arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:############:certificate/########-####-####-####-############\n  external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname:               new-feature.us-east-1.corp.com.,new-feature.corp.com.</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>alb-ingress-controller and external-dns are both <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\">Kubernetes controllers</a> and constantly watch cluster resources for annotations that they know how to handle. In this case, external-dns will know that it shouldn&#8217;t create a record for this <code>Ingress</code> resource until it has been issued an <code>Address</code>, which alb-ingress-controller will take care of in it&#8217;s own control loop. Once an ALB has been provisioned, alb-ingress-controller will tell the Kubernetes API that this <code>Ingress</code> has X <code>Address</code> and external-dns will carry on creating the appropriate records in the appropriate Route53 zones (in this case, external-dns will create an <code>ALIAS</code> record pointing to <code>Ingress.Address</code> and a TXT ownership record within the same Route53 zone (in the same AWS account as our EKS cluster that has been delegated from the main app domain just for these branch deploys).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These things cost money, right, what about the clean-up!?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally, and at the velocity that our developers are working on this app, it can rack up a <s>small</s> bill in EC2 spot instance and ALB costs if we have 20-30 of these branches deployed at once running all the time! We have two methods of cleaning up branch-deploys:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>a GitHub Actions-triggered clean-up run</li><li>a daily clean-up run</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these run the same code each time, but they&#8217;re targeting different things. The GitHub Actions-triggred run is going after deploys for branches that have just been deleted &#8212; it is triggered whenever a <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows\">delete event</a> occurs in the repository. The daily clean-up run is going after deploys that are more than five days old (we do this by comparing the current time with the last deployed time from Helm). We&#8217;ve experimented with different lifespans on branch deploys, but five works for us &#8212; three is too short, seven is too long, it&#8217;s a balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a branch is found and marked for deletion, the clean-up build runs the appropriate <code>helm delete</code> commands against the main app release and the associated Redis release, causing a cascading effect of Kubernetes resources to be cleaned up and deleted, the ALBs to be de-provisioned, and external-dns to remove the records it created (we run external-dns in full-sync mode so that it can delete records that it owns).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Other bits</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We&#8217;ve also run this setup using Jetstack&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager\">cert-manager</a> for issuing certs with Let&#8217;s Encrypt for each branch deploy, but dropped it in favor of wildcard certs managed in AWS Certificate Manager because hell hath no fury like me opening my inbox everyday to find 15 cert expiration emails in it. It also added several extra minutes to the deploy provisioning timeline for new branches &#8212; rather than just having to wait for the ALB to be provisioned and the new DNS records to propagate, you also had to wait for the certificate verification record to be created, propagate, Let&#8217;s Encrypt to issue your cert, etc etc etc.</li><li>DNS propagation can take a while, even if you remove the costly certificate issuance step. This was particularly noticeable if you used <code>bin/deploy</code> locally because the last step of the script is to hit the endpoint for your deploy over and over again until it&#8217;s healthy. This meant that you could end up caching an empty DNS result since external-dns may not have created the record yet (likely, in-fact, for new branches). We help this by setting a low negative caching TTL on the Route53 zone that we use for these deploys.</li><li>There&#8217;s a hard limit on the number of security groups that you can attach to an ENI and there&#8217;s only so much tweaking you can do with AWS support to maximize the number of ALBs that you can have attached to the nodes in an EKS cluster. For us this means limiting the number of branch deploys in a cluster to 30. HOWEVER, I have a stretch goal to fix this by writing a custom controller that will play off of alb-ingress-controller and create host-based routing rules on a single ALB that can serve all beta instances. This would increase the number of deploys per cluster up to 95ish (per ALB since an ALB has a limit on the number of rules attached), and reduce the cost of the entire setup significantly because each ALB costs a minimum of $16/month and each deploy has two ALBs (one external and one internal).</li><li>We re-use the same Helm chart for production, beta, and staging &#8212; the only changes are the database endpoints (between production/beta and staging), some resource requests, and a few environmental variables. Each branch deploy is its own Helm release.</li><li>We use this setup to run a full mail pipeline for each branch deploy, too. This makes it easy for devs to test their changes if they involve mail processing, allowing them to send mail to <code>&lt;their username&gt;@new-feature.corp.com</code> and have it appear in their account as if they sent it through the production mail pipeline. </li><li>Relying on GitHub&#8217;s Deployments API means that we get nice touches in PRs like this:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12600\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/image-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?fit=1354%2C98&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1354,98\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?fit=600%2C43&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?fit=640%2C46&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12600\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?w=1354&amp;ssl=1 1354w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?resize=600%2C43&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?resize=768%2C56&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>complete with a direct link to the temporary deploy environment</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in HEY, checkout <a href=\"https://hey.com\">hey.com</a> and learn about our take on email. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Blake is Senior System Administrator on Basecamp’s Operations team who spends most of his time working with Kubernetes, and AWS, in some capacity.
