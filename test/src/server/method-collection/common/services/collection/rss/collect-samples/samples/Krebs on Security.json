E-Verify&#8217;s consumer-facing portal myE-Verify lets users track and manage employment inquiries made through the E-Verify system. It also features a &#8220;Self Lock&#8221; designed to prevent the misuse of one&#8217;s SSN in E-Verify.</p>\n<p>Enabling this lock is supposed to mean that for the next year thereafter, if an unauthorized individual attempts to fraudulently use a SSN for employment authorization, he or she cannot use the SSN in E-Verify, even if the SSN is that of an employment authorized individual. But in practice, this service may actually do little to deter ID thieves from impersonating you to a potential employer.</p>\n<p>At the request of the reader who reached out (and in the interest of following my own advice to plant one&#8217;s flag), KrebsOnSecurity decided to sign up for a myE-Verify account. After verifying my email address, I was asked to pick a strong password and select a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). The most secure MFA option offered (a one-time code generated by an app like Google Authenticator or Authy) was already pre-selected, so I chose that.</p>\n<p>The site requested my name, address, SSN, date of birth and phone number. I was then asked to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifypasswordquestions.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">select five questions and answers</a> that might be asked if I were to try to reset my password, such as &#8220;In what city/town did you meet your spouse,&#8221; and &#8220;What is the name of the company of your first paid job.&#8221; I chose long, gibberish answers that had nothing to do with the questions (yes, these password questions are next to useless for security and frequently are the cause of account takeovers, but we&#8217;ll get to that in a minute).</p>\n<p>Password reset questions selected, the site proceeded to ask four, multiple-guess &#8220;knowledge-based authentication&#8221; questions to verify my identity. The <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2015/11/your-information-being-used-job-related-id-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">primer page on preventing job-related ID theft</a> says people who have <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">placed a security freeze on their credit files with the major credit bureaus</a> will need to lift or thaw the freeze before being able to answer these questions successfully at myE-Verify. However, I did not find that to be the case, even though my credit file has been frozen with the major bureaus for years.</p>\n<p>After successfully answering the KBA questions (the answer to each was &#8220;none of the above,&#8221; by the way), the site declared I&#8217;d successfully created my account! I could then see that I had the option to place a &#8220;Self Lock&#8221; on my SSN within the E-Verify system.</p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52183\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome.png 1154w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome-580x425.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome-940x689.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/everifywelcome-768x563.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Doing so required me to pick three more challenge questions and answers. The site didn&#8217;t explain why it was asking me to do this, but I assumed it would prompt me for the answers in the event that I later chose to unlock my SSN within E-Verify.</p>\n<p>After selecting and answering those questions and clicking the &#8220;Lock my SSN&#8221; button, the site generated an error message saying something went wrong and it couldn&#8217;t proceed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52179\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifysystemerror-e.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifysystemerror-e.png 1161w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifysystemerror-e-580x420.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifysystemerror-e-940x681.png 940w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/myeverifysystemerror-e-768x556.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" /></p>\n<p>Alas, logging out and logging back in again showed that the site did in fact proceed and that my SSN was locked. Joy.</p>\n<p>But I still had to know one thing: Could someone else come along pretending to be me and create another account using my SSN, date of birth and address but under a different email address? Using a different browser and Internet address, I proceeded to find out.</p>\n<p>Imagine my surprise when I was able to create a separate account as me with just a different email address (once again, the correct answers to all of the KBA questions was &#8220;none of the above&#8221;). Upon logging in, I noticed my SSN was indeed locked within E-Verify. So I chose to unlock it.</p>\n<p>Did the system ask any of the challenge questions it had me create previously? Nope. It just reported that my SSN was now unlocked. Logging out and logging back in to the original account I created (again under a different IP and browser) confirmed that my SSN was unlocked.<span id=\"more-52173\"></span></p>\n<h4>ANALYSIS</h4>\n<p>Obviously, if the E-Verify system allows multiple accounts to be created using the same name, address, phone number, SSN and date of birth, this is less than ideal and somewhat defeats the purpose of creating one for the purposes of protecting one&#8217;s identity from misuse.</p>\n<p>Lest you think your SSN and DOB is somehow private information, you should know this static data about U.S. residents has been exposed many times over in countless data breaches, and in any case these digits are available for sale on most Americans via Dark Web sites for roughly the bitcoin equivalent of a fancy caffeinated drink at Starbucks.</p>\n<p>Being unable to proceed through knowledge-based authentication questions without first unfreezing one&#8217;s credit file with one or all of the big three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) can actually be a plus for those of us who are paranoid about identity theft. I couldn&#8217;t find any mention on the E-Verify site of which company or service it uses to ask these questions, but the fact that the site doesn&#8217;t seem to care whether one has a freeze in place is troubling.</p>\n<p>And when the correct answer to all of the KBA questions that do get asked is invariably &#8220;none of the above,&#8221; that somewhat lessens the value of asking them in the first place. Maybe that was just the luck of the draw in my case, but also troubling nonetheless. Either way, these KBA questions are notoriously weak security because the answers to them often are pulled from records that are public anyway, and can sometimes be deduced by studying the information available on a target&#8217;s social media profiles.</p>\n<p>Speaking of silly questions, relying on &#8220;secret questions&#8221; or &#8220;challenge questions&#8221; as an alternative method of resetting one&#8217;s password is severely outdated and insecure. A 2015 study by <strong>Google</strong> titled &#8220;<a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43783.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secrets, Lies and Account Recovery</a>&#8221; (PDF) found that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than just user-chosen passwords. Also, the idea that an account protected by multi-factor authentication could be undermined by successfully guessing the answer(s) to one or more secret questions (answered truthfully and perhaps located by thieves through mining one&#8217;s social media accounts) is bothersome.</p>\n<p>Finally, the advice given to the reader whose inquiry originally prompted me to sign up at myE-Verify doesn&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with preventing ID thieves from fraudulently claiming unemployment insurance benefits in one&#8217;s name at the state level. KrebsOnSecurity followed up with four different readers who left comments on this site about being victims of unemployment fraud recently, and none of them saw any inquiries about this in their myE-Verify accounts after creating them. Not that they should have seen signs of this activity in the E-Verify system; I just wanted to emphasize that one seems to have little to do with the other.</p>\n",

Image: Gemini Advisory</p></div>\n<p>Naturally, crooks who ply their trade in credit card thievery also have been working from home more throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. That means demand for stolen &#8220;card-not-present&#8221; data &#8212; customer payment information extracted from hacked online merchants and typically used to defraud other e-commerce vendors &#8212; remains high. And so have prices for card-not-present data: Gemini found prices for this commodity actually increased slightly over the past few months.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Barratt</strong> is an investigator with <a href=\"https://www.coalfire.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coalfire</a>, the cyber forensics firm hired by Chicken Express to remediate the breach and help the company improve security going forward. Barratt said there&#8217;s another curious COVID-19 dynamic going on with e-commerce fraud recently that is making it more difficult for banks and card issuers to trace patterns in stolen card-not-present data back to hacked web merchants &#8212; particularly smaller e-commerce shops.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the concerns that has been expressed to me is that we’re getting [fewer] overlapping hotspots,&#8221; Barratt said. &#8220;For a lot of the smaller, more frequently compromised merchants there has been a large drop off in transactions. Whilst big e-commerce has generally done okay during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of more modest sized or specialty online retailers have not had the same access to their supply chain and so have had to close or drastically reduce the lines they’re selling.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Banks routinely take groups of customer cards that have experienced fraudulent activity and try to see if some or all of them were used at the same merchant during a similar timeframe, a basic anti-fraud process known as &#8220;common point of purchase&#8221; or CPP analysis. But ironically, this analysis can become more challenging when there are fewer overall transactions going through a compromised merchant&#8217;s site, Barratt said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a smaller transactional footprint means less Common Point of Purchase alerts and less data to work on to trigger a forensic investigation or fraud alert,&#8221; Barratt said. &#8220;It does also mean less fraud right now – which is a positive. <span class=\"pullquote pqright\">But one of the big concerns that has been raised to us as investigators &#8212; literally asking if we have capacity for what’s coming &#8212; has been that merchants are getting compromised by ‘lie in wait’ type intruders.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Barratt says there&#8217;s a suspicion that hackers may have established beachheads [breachheads?] in a number of these smaller online merchants and are simply biding their time.

Couple all of that with major shopping cart platforms going out of support (<a href=\"https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/supporting-magento-1-through-june-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like Magento 1 this month</a>) and furloughed IT and security staff, and there’s a potentially large COVID-19 breach bubble waiting to pop.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a majority of payment cards issued in the United States now equipped with a chip that makes the cards difficult and expensive for thieves to clone, cybercriminals have continued to focus on hacking smaller merchants that have not yet installed chip card readers and are still swiping the cards&#8217; magnetic stripe at the register.</p>\n<p>Barratt said his company has tied the source of the breach to malware known as &#8220;<a href=\"https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pwnpos-old-undetected-pos-malware-still-causing-havoc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PwnPOS</a>,&#8221; an ancient strain of point-of-sale malware that first surfaced more than seven years ago, if not earlier.</p>\n<p>Chicken Express CEO <strong>Ricky Stuart</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity that apart from &#8220;a handful&#8221; of locations his family owns directly, most of his 250 stores are franchisees that decide on their own how to secure their payment operations. Nevertheless, the company is now forced to examine each store&#8217;s POS systems to remediate the breach.</p>\n<p>Stuart blamed the major point-of-sale vendors for taking their time in supporting and validating chip-capable payment systems. But when asked how many of the company&#8217;s 250 stores had chip-capable readers installed, Stuart said he didn&#8217;t know. Ditto for the handful of stores he owns directly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would think it would be a majority.

Nevertheless, Burkov was extradited to the United States in November 2019. <strong>Russian President Vladimir Putin</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51301827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pardoned Issachar in January 2020</a>, just hours after Burkov pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nyccriminallawyer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arkady Bukh</a> is a New York attorney who has represented a number of accused and convicted cybercriminals from Eastern Europe and Russia.

In an interview today with KrebsOnSecurity, prosecutors in Alaska declined to discuss any of their alleged offenses beyond building, maintaining and selling the above-mentioned IoT botnets.</p>\n<p>But multiple sources tell KrebsOnSecuirty Vamp was principally responsible for <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 2016 massive denial-of-service attack that swamped Dyn</a> — a company that provides core Internet services for a host of big-name Web sites.

Schuchman has been confined to an Alaskan jail for the past 13 months, and <strong>Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess</strong> today ordered the sentence of 18 months community confinement to begin Aug. 1.</p>\n<p>Community confinement in Schuchman&#8217;s case means he will spend most or all of that time in a drug treatment program. In <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kennysentencingrecommendations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a memo</a> (PDF) released prior to Schuchman&#8217;s sentencing today, prosecutors detailed the defendant&#8217;s ongoing struggle with narcotics, noting that on multiple occasions he was discharged from treatment programs after testing positive for <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/suboxone.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Suboxone</a> &#8212; which is used to treat opiate addiction and is sometimes abused by addicts &#8212; and for possessing drug contraband.</p>\n<p>The government&#8217;s sentencing memo also says Schuchman on multiple occasions absconded from pretrial supervision, and went right back to committing the botnet crimes for which he&#8217;d been arrested &#8212; even communicating with Sterritt about the details of the ongoing FBI investigation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Defendant&#8217;s performance on pretrial supervision has been spectacularly poor,&#8221; prosecutors explained. &#8220;Even after being interviewed by the FBI and put on restrictions, he continued to create and operate a DDoS botnet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prosecutors told the judge that when he was ultimately re-arrested by U.S. Marshals, Schuchman was found at a computer in violation of the terms of his release. In that incident, Schuchman allegedly told his dad to trash his computer, before successfully encrypting his hard drive (which the Marshals service is still trying to decrypt). According to the memo, the defendant admitted to marshals that he had received and viewed videos of &#8220;juveniles engaged in sex acts with other juveniles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The circumstances surrounding the defendant’s most recent re-arrest are troubling,&#8221; the memo recounts. &#8220;The management staff at the defendant’s father’s apartment complex, where the defendant was residing while on abscond status, reported numerous complaints against the defendant, including invitations to underage children to swim naked in the pool.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Alexander</strong>, assistant US attorney for the district of Alaska, declined to say whether the DOJ would seek extradition of Sterritt and Shwydiuk. Alexander said the success of these prosecutions is highly dependent on the assistance of domestic and international law enforcement partners, as well as a list of private and public entities named at the conclusion of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Schuchman-Kenneth-ALEXANDER_PELKER.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the DOJ&#8217;s press release on the Schuchman sentencing</a> (PDF).</p>\n<p>However, a <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dkt-3-Motion-to-Seal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DOJ motion</a> (PDF) to seal the case records filed back in September 2019 says the government is in fact seeking to extradite the defendants.</p>\n<p>Chief Judge Burgess was the same magistrate who presided over <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/mirai-co-author-gets-6-months-confinement-8-6m-in-fines-for-rutgers-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 2018 sentencing</a> of the co-authors of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mirai</a>, a highly disruptive IoT botnet strain whose <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source code was leaked online in 2016</a> and was built upon by the defendants in this case. Both Mirai co-authors were sentenced to community service and home confinement thanks to their considerable cooperation with the government&#8217;s ongoing IoT botnet investigations.</p>\n<p>Asked whether he was satisfied with the sentence handed down against Schuchman, Alexander maintained it was more than just another slap on the wrist, noting that Schuchman has waived his right to appeal the conviction and faces additional confinement of two years if he absconds again or fails to complete his treatment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In every case the statutory factors have to do with the history of the defendants, who in these crimes tend to be extremely youthful offenders,&#8221; Alexander said. &#8220;In this case, we had a young man who struggles with mental health and really pronounced substance abuse issues. Contrary to what many people might think, the goal of the DOJ in cases like this is not to put people in jail for as long as possible but to try to achieve the best balance of safeguarding communities and affording the defendant the best possible chance of rehabilitation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>William Walton</strong>, supervisory special agent for the FBI&#8217;s cybercrime investigation division in Anchorage, Ala., said he hopes today&#8217;s indictments and sentencing send a clear message to what he described as a relatively insular and small group of individuals who are still building, running and leasing IoT-based botnets to further a range of cybercrimes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things we hope in our efforts here and in our partnerships with our international partners is when we identify these people, we want very much to hold them to account in a just but appropriate way,&#8221; Walton said. &#8220;Hopefully, any associates who are aspiring to fill the vacuum once we take some players off the board realize that there are going to be real consequences for doing that.&#8221;</p>\n",

The NFCA alert noted that the dates of the files in the leak actually span nearly 24 years &#8212; from August 1996 through June 19, 2020 &#8212; and that the documents include names, email addresses, phone numbers, PDF documents, images, and a large number of text, video, CSV and ZIP files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, the data dump contains emails and associated attachments,&#8221; the alert reads. &#8220;Our initial analysis revealed that some of these files contain highly sensitive information such as ACH routing numbers, international bank account numbers (IBANs), and other financial data as well as personally identifiable information (PII) and images of suspects listed in Requests for Information (RFIs) and other law enforcement and government agency reports.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-52051\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ncfa-top.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"111\" /></p>\n<p>The NFCA said it appears the data published by BlueLeaks was taken after a security breach at <a href=\"https://netsential.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Netsential</a>, a Houston-based web development firm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Preliminary analysis of the data contained in this leak suggests that Netsential, a web services company used by multiple fusion centers, law enforcement, and other government agencies across the United States, was the source of the compromise,&#8221; the NFCA wrote. &#8220;Netsential confirmed that this compromise was likely the result of a threat actor who leveraged a compromised Netsential customer user account and the web platform’s upload feature to introduce malicious content, allowing for the exfiltration of other Netsential customer data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reached via phone Sunday evening, Netsential Director <strong>Stephen Gartrell</strong> declined to comment for this story.<span id=\"more-52037\"></span></p>\n<p>The NFCA said a variety of cyber threat actors, including nation-states, hacktivists, and financially-motivated cybercriminals, might seek to exploit the data exposed in this breach to target fusion centers and associated agencies and their personnel in various cyber attacks and campaigns.</p>\n<p>The BlueLeaks data set was released June 19, also known as &#8220;Juneteenth,&#8221; the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. This year&#8217;s observance of the date has generated renewed public interest in the wake of widespread protests against police brutality and the filmed killing of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd-who-is.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">George Floyd</a> at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/stewart-baker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stewart Baker</a>, an attorney at the Washington, D.C. office of <strong>Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP</strong> and a former assistant secretary of policy at the <strong>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</strong>, said the BlueLeaks data is unlikely to shed much light on police misconduct, but could expose sensitive law enforcement investigations and even endanger lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With this volume of material, there are bound to be compromises of sensitive operations and maybe even human sources or undercover police, so I fear it will put lives at risk,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;Every organized crime operation in the country will likely have searched for their own names before law enforcement knows what&#8217;s in the files, so the damage could be done quickly. I&#8217;d also be surprised if the files produce much scandal or evidence of police misconduct. That&#8217;s not the kind of work the fusion centers do.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content:encoded": "<p>Hundreds of popular websites now offer some form of <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> (MFA), which can help users safeguard access to accounts when their password is breached or stolen. But people who don&#8217;t take advantage of these added safeguards may find it far more difficult to regain access when their account gets hacked, because increasingly thieves will enable multi-factor options and tie the account to a device they control. Here&#8217;s the story of one such incident.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-52028\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mfa.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"298\" /></p>\n<p>As a career chief privacy officer for different organizations, <strong>Dennis Dayman</strong> has tried to instill in his twin boys the importance of securing their online identities against account takeovers. Both are avid gamers on <strong>Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox</strong> platform, and for years their father managed their accounts via his own Microsoft account. But when the boys turned 18, they converted their child accounts to adult, effectively taking themselves out from under their dad&#8217;s control.</p>\n<p>On a recent morning, one of Dayman&#8217;s sons found he could no longer access his Xbox account. The younger Dayman admitted to his dad that he&#8217;d reused his Xbox profile password elsewhere, and that he hadn&#8217;t enabled multi-factor authentication for the account.</p>\n<p>When the two of them sat down to reset his password, the screen displayed a notice saying there was a new Gmail address tied to his Xbox account. When they went to turn on multi-factor authentication for his son&#8217;s Xbox profile &#8212; which was tied to a non-Microsoft email address &#8212; the Xbox service said it would send a notification of the change to unauthorized Gmail account in his profile.</p>\n<p>Wary of alerting the hackers that they were wise to their intrusion, Dennis tried contacting Microsoft Xbox support, but found he couldn&#8217;t open a support ticket from a non-Microsoft account. Using his other son&#8217;s Outlook account, he filed a ticket about the incident with Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Dennis soon learned the unauthorized Gmail address added to his son&#8217;s hacked Xbox account also had enabled MFA. Meaning, his son would be unable to reset the account&#8217;s password without approval from the person in control of the Gmail account.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Dayman&#8217;s son, he hadn&#8217;t re-used the same password for the email address tied to his Xbox profile. Nevertheless, the thieves began abusing their access to purchase games on Xbox and third-party sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During this period, we started realizing that his bank account was being drawn down through purchases of games from Xbox and [Electronic Arts],&#8221; Dayman the elder recalled. &#8220;I pulled the recovery codes for his Xbox account out of the safe, but because the hacker came in and turned on multi-factor, those codes were useless to us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Microsoft support sent Dayman and his son a list of 20 questions to answer about their account, such as the serial number on the Xbox console originally tied to the account when it was created. But despite answering all of those questions successfully, Microsoft refused to let them reset the password, Dayman said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They said their policy was not to turn over accounts to someone who couldn&#8217;t provide the second factor,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Dayman&#8217;s case was eventually escalated to Tier 3 Support at Microsoft, which was able to walk him through creating a new Microsoft account, enabling MFA on it, and then migrating his son&#8217;s Xbox profile over to the new account.</p>\n<p>Microsoft told KrebsOnSecurity that while users currently are not prompted to enable two-step verification upon sign-up, they always have the option <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-how-to-use-two-step-verification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to enable the feature</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users are also prompted shortly after account creation to add additional security information if they have not yet done so, which enables the customer to receive security alerts and security promotions when they login to their account,&#8221; the company said in a written statement. &#8220;When we notice an unusual sign-in attempt from a new location or device, we help protect the account by challenging the login and send the user a notification. If a customer’s account is ever compromised, we will take the necessary steps <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/microsoft-account-recover-hacked-compromised-account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to help them recover the account</a>.&#8221;<span id=\"more-51979\"></span></p>\n<p>Certainly, not enabling MFA when it is offered is far more of a risk for people in the habit of reusing or recycling passwords across multiple sites. But any service to which you entrust sensitive information can get hacked, and enabling multi-factor authentication is a good hedge against having leaked or stolen credentials used to plunder your account.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, a great many online sites and services that do support multi-factor authentication are completely automated and extremely difficult to reach for help when account takeovers occur. This is doubly so if the attackers also can modify and/or remove the original email address associated with the account.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity has long steered readers to the site <a href=\"https://www.twofactorauth.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twofactorauth.org</a>, which details the various MFA options offered by popular websites. Currently, twofactorauth.org lists nearly 900 sites that have some form of MFA available. These range from authentication options like <a href=\"https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/time-based-one-time-password-TOTP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-time codes</a> sent via email, phone calls, SMS or mobile app, to more robust, true &#8220;2-factor authentication&#8221; or 2FA options (something you have and something you know), such as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=security+keys&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">security keys</a> or push-based 2FA such as <a href=\"https://duo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duo Security</a> (an advertiser on this site and a service I have used for years).</p>\n<p>Email, SMS and app-based one-time codes are considered less robust from a security perspective because they can be undermined by a variety of well-established attack scenarios, from <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swap&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SIM-swapping</a> to mobile-based malware. So it makes sense to secure your accounts with the strongest form of MFA available. But please bear in mind that if the only added authentication options offered by a site you frequent are SMS and/or phone calls, this is still better than simply relying on a password to secure your account.</p>\n",

The fraudulent tax refund claims made in the names of UPMC identity theft victims caused the IRS to issue $1.7 million in phony refunds in 2014.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The information was sold by Johnson on dark web forums for use by conspirators, who promptly filed hundreds of false form 1040 tax returns in 2014 using UPMC employee PII,&#8221; reads <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/michigan-man-arrested-2014-hack-upmc-hr-databases-and-theft-employees-personal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a statement</a> from <strong>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady</strong>. &#8220;These false 1040 filings claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars of false tax refunds, which they converted into Amazon.com gift cards, which were then used to purchase Amazon merchandise which was shipped to Venezuela.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Johnson could not be reached for comment. At a court hearing in Pittsburgh this week, a judge ordered the defendant to be detained pending trial. Johnson&#8217;s attorney declined to comment on the charges.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors allege Johnson&#8217;s intrusion into UPMC was not an isolated occurrence, and that for several years after the UPMC hack he sold personally identifiable information (PII) to buyers on dark web forums.</p>\n<p>The indictment says Johnson used the hacker aliases &#8220;DS and &#8220;TDS&#8221; to market the stolen records to identity thieves on the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=evolution+market&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evolution</a> and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/alphabay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AlphaBay</a> dark web marketplaces. However, archived copies of the now-defunct dark web forums indicate those aliases are merely abbreviations that stand for &#8220;<strong>DearthStar</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>TheDearthStar</strong>,&#8221; respectively.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can expect good things come tax time as I will have lots of profiles with verified prior year AGIs to make your refund filing 10x easier,&#8221; TheDearthStar advertised in an August 2015 message to AlphaBay members.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it appears these DearthStar identities were actively involved in not just selling PII and tax refund fraud, but also stealing directly from corporate payrolls.</p>\n<p>In an Aug. 2015 post to AlphaBay titled &#8220;I&#8217;d like to stage a heist but&#8230;,&#8221; TheDearthStar solicited people to help him cash out access he had to the payroll systems of several different companies:</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; I have nowhere to send the money. I&#8217;d like to leverage the access I have to payroll systems of a few companies and swipe a chunk of their payroll. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to find somebody who has a network of trusted individuals who can receive ACH deposits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When another AlphaBay member asks how much he can get, TheDearthStar responds, &#8220;Depends on how many people end up having their payroll records &#8216;adjusted.&#8217; Could be $1,000 could be $100,000.&#8221;<span id=\"more-52007\"></span></p>\n<p>2014 and 2015 were particularly bad years for tax refund fraud, a form of identity theft which cost taxpayers and the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars.

A <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjjjust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn resume for a Justin Johnson</a> from Detroit says the same, and that for the past five months he has served as an information technology specialist at FEMA.

The analysis highlights a shocking series of security failures at one of the world&#8217;s most secretive entities, but the underlying weaknesses that gave rise to the breach also unfortunately are all too common in many organizations today.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51989\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/intelbrief.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"335\" /></p>\n<p>The CIA produced the report in October 2017, roughly seven months after Wikileaks began publishing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vault 7</a> &#8212; reams of classified data detailing the CIA&#8217;s capabilities to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare.

What kind of security failures created an environment that allegedly allowed a former CIA employee to exfiltrate so much sensitive data? Here are a few, in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failing to rapidly detect security incidents.</li>\n<li>Failing to act on warning signs about potentially risky employees.</li>\n<li>Moving too slowly to enact key security safeguards.</li>\n<li>A lack of user activity monitoring or robust server audit capability.</li>\n<li>No effective removable media controls.</li>\n<li>No single person empowered to ensure IT systems are built and maintained securely throughout their lifecycle.</li>\n<li>Historical data available to all users indefinitely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Substitute the phrase &#8220;cyber weapons&#8221; with &#8220;productivity&#8221; or just &#8220;IT systems&#8221; in the CIA&#8217;s report and you might be reading the post-mortem produced by a security firm hired to help a company recover from a highly damaging data breach.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51988\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51988\" class=\" wp-image-51988\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cia-intelbrief.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"699\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-51988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A redacted portion of the CIA&#8217;s report on the Wikileaks breach.</p></div>\n<p><span id=\"more-51981\"></span></p>\n<h4>DIVIDED WE STAND, UNITED WE FALL</h4>\n<p>A key phrase in the CIA&#8217;s report references deficiencies in &#8220;compartmentalizing&#8221; cybersecurity risk. At a high level (not necessarily specific to the CIA), compartmentalizing IT environments involves important concepts such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Segmenting one&#8217;s network so that malware infections or breaches in one part of the network can&#8217;t spill over into other areas.</li>\n<li>Not allowing multiple users to share administrative-level passwords</li>\n<li>Developing baselines for user and network activity so that deviations from the norm stand out more prominently.</li>\n<li>Continuously inventorying, auditing, logging and monitoring all devices and user accounts connected to the organization&#8217;s IT network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The Agency for years has developed and operated IT mission systems outside the purview and governance of enterprise IT, citing the need for mission functionality and speed,&#8221; the CIA observed. &#8220;While often fulfilling a valid purpose, this &#8216;shadow IT&#8217; exemplifies a broader cultural issue that separates enterprise IT from mission IT, has allowed mission system owners to determine how or if they will police themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All organizations experience intrusions, security failures and oversights of key weaknesses. In large enough enterprises, these failures likely happen multiple times each day. But by far the biggest factor that allows small intrusions to morph into a full-on data breach is a lack of ability to quickly detect and respond to security incidents.</p>\n<p>Also, because employees tend to be the most abundant security weakness in any organization, instituting some kind of continuing security awareness training for all employees is a good idea. Some security experts I know and respect dismiss security awareness programs as a waste of time and money, observing that no matter how much training a company does, there will always be some percentage of users who will click on anything.</p>\n<p>That may or may not be accurate, but even if it is, at least the organization then has a much better idea which employees probably need more granular security controls (i.e. more compartmentalizing) to keep them from becoming a serious security liability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden-cybersecurity-lapses-letter-to-dni.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sen.

      "content:encoded": "<p>For the past year, a site called <strong>Privnotes.com</strong> has been impersonating <strong>Privnote.com</strong>, a legitimate, free service that offers private, encrypted messages which self-destruct automatically after they are read. Until recently, I couldn&#8217;t quite work out what Privnotes was up to, but today it became crystal clear: Any messages containing bitcoin addresses will be automatically altered to include a different bitcoin address, as long as the Internet addresses of the sender and receiver of the message are not the same.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, KrebsOnSecurity heard from the owners of Privnote.com, who complained that someone had set up a fake clone of their site that was fooling quite a few regular users of the service.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not hard to see why: Privnotes.com is confusingly similar in name and appearance to the real thing, and comes up second in Google search results for the term &#8220;privnote.&#8221; Also, anyone who mistakenly types &#8220;privnotes&#8221; into Google search may see at the top of the results a misleading paid ad for &#8220;Privnote&#8221; that actually leads to privnotes.com.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51963\" style=\"width: 605px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51963\" class=\" wp-image-51963\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/privnotes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"482\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-51963\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Google search for the term &#8220;privnotes&#8221; brings up a misleading paid ad for the phishing site privnotes.com, which is listed above the legitimate site &#8212; privnote.com.</p></div>\n<p>Privnote.com (the legit service) employs technology that encrypts all messages so that even Privnote itself <a href=\"https://privnote.com/info/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cannot read the contents of the message</a>. And it doesn&#8217;t send and receive messages. Creating a message merely generates a link. When that link is clicked or visited, the service warns that the message will be gone forever after it is read.</p>\n<p>But according to the owners of Privnote.com, the phishing site Privnotes.com does not fully implement encryption, and can read and/or modify all messages sent by users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is very simple to check that the note in privnoteS is sent unencrypted in plain text,&#8221; Privnote.com explained in a February 2020 message, responding to inquiries from KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;Moreover, it doesn&#8217;t enforce any kind of decryption key when opening a note and the key after # in the URL can be replaced by arbitrary characters and the note will still open.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the half of it. KrebsOnSecurity has learned that <em>the phishing site Privnotes.com uses some kind of automated script that scours messages for bitcoin addresses, and replaces any bitcoin addresses found with its own bitcoin address</em>. The script apparently only modifies messages if the note is opened from a different Internet address than the one that composed the address.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example, using the bitcoin wallet address <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">from bitcoin&#8217;s Wikipedia page</a> as an example. The following message was composed at Privnotes.com from a computer with an Internet address in New York, with the message, &#8220;please send money to bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq thanks&#8221;:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51960\" style=\"width: 606px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/privnotes-original.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51960\" class=\"wp-image-51960\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/privnotes-original.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"350\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-51960\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A test message composed on privnotes.com, which is phishing users of the legitimate encrypted message service privnote.com. Pay special attention to the bitcoin address in this message.</p></div>\n<p>When I visited the Privnotes.com link generated by clicking the &#8220;create note&#8221; button on the above page from a different computer with an Internet address in California, this was the result. As you can see, it lists a different bitcoin address, albeit one with the same first four characters.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51961\" style=\"width: 607px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/privnotes-alt.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51961\" class=\"wp-image-51961\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/privnotes-alt.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"432\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-51961\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The altered message. Notice the bitcoin address has been modified and is not the same address that was sent in the original note.</p></div>\n<p>Several other tests confirmed that the bitcoin modifying script does not seem to change message contents if the sender and receiver&#8217;s IP addresses are the same, or if one composes multiple notes with the same bitcoin address in it.<span id=\"more-51956\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, the security expert who helped me with this testing, said the script also only seems to replace the first instance of a bitcoin address if it&#8217;s repeated within a message, and the site stops replacing a wallet address if it is sent repeatedly over multiple messages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And because of the design of the site, the sender won&#8217;t be able to view the message because it self destructs after one open, and the type of people using privnote aren&#8217;t the type of people who are going to send that bitcoin wallet any other way for verification purposes,&#8221; said Nixon, who is chief research officer at <a href=\"https://unit221b.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unit 221B</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty smart scam.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Given that Privnotes.com is phishing bitcoin users, it&#8217;s a fair bet the phony service also is siphoning other sensitive data from people who use their site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So if there are password dumps in the message, they would be able to read that, too,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;At first, I thought that was their whole angle, just to siphon data. But the bitcoin wallet replacement is probably much closer to the main motivation for running the fake site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even if you never use or plan to use the legitimate encrypted message service Privnote.com, this scam is a great reminder why it pays to be extra careful about using search engines to find sites that you plan to entrust with sensitive data. A far better approach is to bookmark such sites, and rely exclusively on those instead.</p>\n",
