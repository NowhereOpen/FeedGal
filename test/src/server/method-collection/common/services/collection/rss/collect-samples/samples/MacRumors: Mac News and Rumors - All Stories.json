      "content": "Apple in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> redesigned the Home Screen for the first time in a long time, introducing an App Library that lets you hide apps, widgets that can be placed among apps, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/ios14-and-Home-Screen-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749669\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThis guide walks through all of the new Home Screen changes from widgets to the App Library, and includes how tos with walkthroughs on using all of the new features.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"widgets\">Widgets</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nWidgets have been available in the Today View, which can be accessed by swiping from left to right on the Home Screen, but in &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj;, widgets got a design and functionality overhaul.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/widgetsios14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749537\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple overhauled all of its widgets, introducing a fresh design that uses less transparency, more spacing, and richer content to make widgets more useful. The redesign was implemented because for the first time, widgets can move out of the Today View and right onto the Home Screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3>Widget Sizes and Functions</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nWidgets can be customized with up to three sizes: small, medium, and large. A different amount of information is provided with each widget size.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/ios14widgetsizes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1289\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747818\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a> app, for example, a small widget shows just one headline, but a large widget shows three. A small Weather app widget shows the current temperature, the medium version shows the full daily forecast, and the large version shows the weekly forecast. Not all widgets have all three sizes, but most do, and you can also create multiple widgets of the same app. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSome apps also have different widget options based on function. In the &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj; widget, you can choose to see relevant news from the day or get stories about a specific topic of interest.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDevelopers will be able to create widgets using the new sizes and widget design language for widgets that will blend better with Apple's new options.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3>Widget Stacks</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nMultiple widgets can be stacked on top of one another so you can put all of your favorites together and then swap between them with an upward or downward swipe of the finger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/ios14stacks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747819\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has also added a special \"Smart Stack,\" which is a widget stack that uses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Intelligence to surface the most relevant and useful widget based on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> usage habits.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you often order coffee in the morning, for example, the widget for a coffee app might pop up. If you always listen to a podcast on the way home from work and have the Podcast app widget in your stack, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will surface the widget at the appropriate time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions Widget</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's a separate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions widget that on the surface sounds similar to Smart Stack, but is in fact different. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions Widget surfaces app suggestions based on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage habits, similar to what shows up under &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions when you use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s search function.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's also an option to have the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions widget display Shortcut suggestions based on your most used Shortcuts and Shortcut usage patterns.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"widget_gallery\">Widget Gallery</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nAdding and customizing widgets can be done through the Widget Gallery, accessible by long pressing on the Today View of the widget list and then tapping the \"+\" button in the upper left corner.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/ios14widgetgallery.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747816\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nFrom there, you can search for a specific widget or scroll through the available options. Tapping on a widget in the list lets you see the size and content options that are available for the widget. Adding a widget to the Today View can be done by tapping the \"Add Widget\" option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you long press on the Today View screen and do not tap the \"+\" button, you can rearrange widgets, delete widgets, or scroll down to the \"Edit\" option that lets you see all of your widgets in a quick view list, including those from third-party developers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"widgets_on_the_home_screen\">Widgets on the Home Screen</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nAny widget that's available in the Today View can also be added to the Home Screen. You can drag them out from the Today View or long press on the Home Screen to get to the interface editing options.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/ios14homescreenwidgets.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747817\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn this view, tap on the \"+\" button to get to the Widget Gallery to put a new widget right on the Home Screen. Widgets on the Home Screen behave just like app icons, they're just a bit bigger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWidgets can be placed on the Home Screen right alongside apps. A small widget takes up the space of four apps in a square shape, a medium widget takes up the space of eight apps in a rectangle shape, and a large widget takes up the space of 16 apps in a square shape.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can have widgets next to apps or a screen that's all widgets, and everything can be rearranged by long pressing on the Home Screen to get to jiggle mode and then just dragging icons around.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"app_library\">App Library</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nAlong with widget redesign and the option to add widgets to the Home Screen, Apple added an App Library, designed to let you see all of the apps that you have in one easy to access place.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/applibrary.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749538\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApp Library can be accessed by swiping from right to left through all of the Home Screen app pages until you get to the end. The App Library features smart organization, and all of the apps installed on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are separated into smart folders.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSome of the folder options include Productivity, Utilities, Social, Creativity, Reference &amp; Reading, Health &amp; Fitness, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Games, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, and Education.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere is no way to change the organization of the folders because it's automatic. Each folder displays your top three most used apps along with a collection of four app icons that you can tap on to see all of the other apps in that particular folder.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has also added a \"Suggestions\" folder based on your app usage habits that houses apps you might want to use at a particular time. There's also a \"Recently Added\" folder to make it easy to find your newest apps. If you want your App Library apps to show notification badges, open up the Settings app, choose \"Home Screen\" and then toggle on the \"Show in App Library\" option under Notification Badges.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/ios14applibrarysuggestions.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"904\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747822\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nLong pressing on the main App Library page causes the apps to jiggle, letting apps be deleted right from the App Library. Alternatively, you can also long press on any app icon and select the \"Delete app\" option.\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-app-library-iphone/\">How to Use the App Library on iPhone</a></li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul><h2 id=\"app_library_search\">App Library Search</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe App Library has another view, which is an alphabetical list of all of the apps you have installed. You can get to it by tapping on the search bar at the top of the App Library interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/applibraryalphabet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749539\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the alphabetical list, you can scroll through all of the apps, search for an app, or use the letter bar at the right side of the app to skip to a specific app. You can launch apps from the alphabetical list in the App Library, but you can't delete apps from that location.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"hiding_home_screen_pages_and_apps\">Hiding Home Screen Pages and Apps</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nWith all apps available in the App Library, there's no longer a need to have apps on your Home Screen or Home Screen pages if you'd rather have a cleaner look for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/apppagesios14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749540\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn fact, you can hide entire app pages (the pages you swipe between to get to different screens of apps) or you can hide specific apps one by one. To hide whole app pages, long press on the Home Screen or any app page to enter the jiggle editing mode, then tap on the icon at the bottom that has a series of dots representing each page of apps.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFrom here, you can check or uncheck any app page that you want to hide. You can hide all but one app page, because at least one needs to be visible.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you want to hide a specific app rather than an entire page, just long press on the app's icon, tap \"Edit Home Screen,\" tap on the \"-\" icon on the app, and then choose the \"Remove from Home Screen\" option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/07/removeappsfromhomescreen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1946\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-749541\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nTo download all new apps to the App Library rather than the Home Screen, go to Settings > Home Screen and tap the \"App Library Only\" option under New App Downloads.\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hide-home-screen-app-pages-iphone/\">How to Hide Home Screen App Pages on an iPhone</a></li>\r\n<br/>\r\n <li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-new-apps-to-app-library-iphone/\">How to Download New Apps to the App Library on iPhone</a></li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul><h2 id=\"guide_feedback\">Guide Feedback</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nHave questions about the &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; Home Screen changes, know of a feature we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide? <a href=\"mailto:juli@macrumors.com\">Send us an email here</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">iOS 14 Home Screen Changes: App Library, Widgets, Hiding Apps and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-home-screen-changes-app-library-widgets-hiding-apps-and-more.2245119/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KgfLGkWv-i8:e5QTpDuMkng:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KgfLGkWv-i8:e5QTpDuMkng:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KgfLGkWv-i8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

You can hide all but one app page, because at least one needs to be visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to hide a specific app rather than an entire page, just long press on the app's icon, tap \"Edit Home Screen,\" tap on the \"-\" icon on the app, and then choose the \"Remove from Home Screen\" option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo download all new apps to the App Library rather than the Home Screen, go to Settings > Home Screen and tap the \"App Library Only\" option under New App Downloads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n How to Hide Home Screen App Pages on an iPhone\r\n\r\n How to Download New Apps to the App Library on iPhone\r\n\r\nGuide Feedback\r\n\r\nHave questions about the &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; Home Screen changes, know of a feature we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide?

      "contentSnippet": "Belkin today added to its lineup of wireless chargers with a range of new special Boost Charge wireless charging options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boost Charge 3-in-1 Wireless Charger Special Edition, priced at $130, allows the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods to be charged at the same time. There's an upright charger for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, a charging puck for the &zwnj;Apple Watch&zwnj;, and then the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; charge right behind the &zwnj;Apple Watch&zwnj; in a dedicated charging space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of the special edition charger is similar to the original 3-in-1 Boost Charge, which we reviewed back in June. The special edition version has a different upright charging base and a rectangular shape, plus it comes in black or white. It charges the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at 7.5W and the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; at 5W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelkin's Boost Charge Portable Wireless Charger and Stand Special Edition, priced at $80, is a wireless charger with a built-in battery pack that can be used for charging on the go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 10,000mAh battery pack attaches to the charging stand and wirelessly charges the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in an upright landscape or portrait position when connected, but it can be detached and used when traveling.

Widgets can now be placed right next to your apps, and with the focus on widgets, Apple has introduced new widgets from default apps and is allowing them to be customized in three sizes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can put widgets anywhere on any app page, with new widgets able to be found in the widget gallery. Along with widgets, Apple has introduced an App Library, which is an interface that shows all of the apps on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> both in smart folders that are created automatically and in an alphabetical list.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/ios14applibrary.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747532\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith the App Library providing access to all your apps, there's now an option to hide entire app pages from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so you can avoid a cluttered Home Screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has worked to make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s interface more compact, and incoming phone calls and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> requests no longer take over the whole screen and are instead presented in a banner style, a feature also available on &zwnj;iPadOS&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/ios-14-includes-picture-in-picture-mode-for-iphone/\">Picture in Picture mode</a> for watching videos or using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> while doing something else at the same time on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The Messages app has new features focused on group conversations like pinned conversations, mentions, and inline replies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/ios-14-app-clips/\">new App Clips</a> feature lets you use small bite sized bits of an app without the need to download the whole app, useful for times when you need an app to buy a coffee, rent a scooter, or make a restaurant reservation. App Clips will work through Apple-designed App Clip codes, NFC tags, or QR codes, and can also be shared in Messages or from Safari.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Health app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/new-sleep-tracking-feature-apple-watch/\">supports the Sleep Tracking</a> feature added in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a>, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will support the Sleep Mode and Wind Down features designed to help you get a better night's sleep. There's also a new Health Checklist that makes it easier to manage health and safety features like Emergency SOS, Fall Detection, and Medical ID.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Weather app now provides info on severe weather events and minute-by-minute precipitation readings (U.S. only), and the Maps app supports cycling directions for the first time so bike riders can plan routes with info like busy streets, elevation changes, stairs, and more. Maps also now lets electric vehicle owners plan routes with EV charging spots.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Home app is smarter with automation suggestions and an Adaptive Lighting feature that lets <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> lights adjust their color temperature throughout the day, plus there are new features for &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; Secure Cameras.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/translateconversationmodeios14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1007\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-747837\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nA new Apple-designed Translate app provides text and voice translations to and from 11 languages, and with an on-device mode, translations can be done entirely on your phone.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTons of new privacy features have been added in iOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;. Apps need permission before accessing devices on a local network, you get notified when an app accesses the clipboard, and there are little icons in the status bar of the Home Screen when an app is using the camera or the microphone.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are also new options for limiting access to select photos and providing apps with an approximate location rather than an exact location for better privacy protection. Safari has Privacy Report that tells you which trackers sites are using, and in the future, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> will include a summary of developers' privacy practices in an easy-to-read format.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> can now seamlessly and automatically switch between devices, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> gain a new spatial audio feature for surround sound complete with dynamic head tracking.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/ipadossidebars.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1348\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-748483\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs for &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;, it includes most of the new &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; updates, minus the Home Screen redesign. The biggest change is the new Scribble feature that lets you use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> to write on any text field, with the written text converted to typed text.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nScribble works throughout the operating system so you can use the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for Safari searches, adding new items in Calendar and Reminders, sending Messages, handwriting in the Notes app, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj; beta 2 introduced a handful of tweaks and changes such as a new Calendar app icon, a Files widget, tweaks to Control Center, and more, with a full list <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/07/everything-new-ios-14-beta-2/\">available in our iOS 14 beta 2 tidbits article</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor more on everything that's new in iOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;, make sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a> roundups, which have a detailed look on all of the new features.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/09/apple-releases-ios-14-public-beta/\">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 to Public Beta Testers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-14-and-ipados-14-to-public-beta-testers.2245065/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I4hbNwhuxtU:qBKF2xxrF6k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I4hbNwhuxtU:qBKF2xxrF6k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/I4hbNwhuxtU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Widgets can now be placed right next to your apps, and with the focus on widgets, Apple has introduced new widgets from default apps and is allowing them to be customized in three sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can put widgets anywhere on any app page, with new widgets able to be found in the widget gallery. Along with widgets, Apple has introduced an App Library, which is an interface that shows all of the apps on your iPhone both in smart folders that are created automatically and in an alphabetical list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the App Library providing access to all your apps, there's now an option to hide entire app pages from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so you can avoid a cluttered Home Screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApple has worked to make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s interface more compact, and incoming phone calls and Siri requests no longer take over the whole screen and are instead presented in a banner style, a feature also available on &zwnj;iPadOS&zwnj;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a Picture in Picture mode for watching videos or using FaceTime while doing something else at the same time on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The Messages app has new features focused on group conversations like pinned conversations, mentions, and inline replies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new App Clips feature lets you use small bite sized bits of an app without the need to download the whole app, useful for times when you need an app to buy a coffee, rent a scooter, or make a restaurant reservation. App Clips will work through Apple-designed App Clip codes, NFC tags, or QR codes, and can also be shared in Messages or from Safari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Health app supports the Sleep Tracking feature added in watchOS 7, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will support the Sleep Mode and Wind Down features designed to help you get a better night's sleep. There's also a new Health Checklist that makes it easier to manage health and safety features like Emergency SOS, Fall Detection, and Medical ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weather app now provides info on severe weather events and minute-by-minute precipitation readings (U.S. only), and the Maps app supports cycling directions for the first time so bike riders can plan routes with info like busy streets, elevation changes, stairs, and more. Maps also now lets electric vehicle owners plan routes with EV charging spots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Home app is smarter with automation suggestions and an Adaptive Lighting feature that lets HomeKit lights adjust their color temperature throughout the day, plus there are new features for &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; Secure Cameras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA new Apple-designed Translate app provides text and voice translations to and from 11 languages, and with an on-device mode, translations can be done entirely on your phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTons of new privacy features have been added in iOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;. Apps need permission before accessing devices on a local network, you get notified when an app accesses the clipboard, and there are little icons in the status bar of the Home Screen when an app is using the camera or the microphone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also new options for limiting access to select photos and providing apps with an approximate location rather than an exact location for better privacy protection. Safari has Privacy Report that tells you which trackers sites are using, and in the future, the App Store will include a summary of developers' privacy practices in an easy-to-read format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirPods can now seamlessly and automatically switch between devices, and AirPods Pro gain a new spatial audio feature for surround sound complete with dynamic head tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;, it includes most of the new &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; updates, minus the Home Screen redesign. The biggest change is the new Scribble feature that lets you use the Apple Pencil to write on any text field, with the written text converted to typed text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScribble works throughout the operating system so you can use the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; for Safari searches, adding new items in Calendar and Reminders, sending Messages, handwriting in the Notes app, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj; beta 2 introduced a handful of tweaks and changes such as a new Calendar app icon, a Files widget, tweaks to Control Center, and more, with a full list available in our iOS 14 beta 2 tidbits article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more on everything that's new in iOS and &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj;, make sure to check out our iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 roundups, which have a detailed look on all of the new features.Related Roundups: iOS 14, iPadOS 14This article, \"Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 to Public Beta Testers\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple says the first Arm-based Mac is set to be introduced before the end of 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, Apple has also stated that it will take two years to transition its entire Mac lineup to &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj;, so depending on what kind of Mac you want, you could be in for a long wait.Related Roundups: iMac, Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air, MacBook ProTag: Apple SiliconBuyer's Guide: iMac (Don't Buy), Mac Pro (Buy Now), Mac Mini (Buy Now), MacBook Air (Buy Now), 13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now), 16\" MacBook Pro (Caution)This article, \"Should I Buy an Intel Mac Today or Wait to Buy an Arm-Based Mac?\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

When purchased from Apple, the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; maxes out at 8TB of storage, so Sonnet's add-on provides a huge storage boost. The storage added through the Fusion Flex J3i will not, of course, act as a main boot disk and will instead work like an external drive that's plugged into the Mac.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou don't get any storage with the Fusion Flex J3i since it's designed to be a mounting system, so you're going to need to purchase storage separately and add it yourself. The Fusion Flex J3i supports two 3.5-inch drives and one 2.5-inch SSD or three 2.5-inch SSDs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe tested the Fusion Flex J3i with two 4TB 3.5-inch hard drives from Western Digital, and installation was simple. Just four screws attach each of the hard drives to the J3i after the SSD plates have been removed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter the Fusion Flex J3i has been outfitted with SSDs or hard drives, it also takes just a few minutes to get it up and running in the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;. Pull off the cover, unscrew the plate at the top, and then insert the J3i into the machine.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe hard drives will connect to the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; and then you can attach the three SATA cables that come with the J3i, and since the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; has 1, 2, and 3, labeling, it's pretty easy to tell what goes where. After the mount is in place, put the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; back together, boot up, and all should be working well.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe found the Fusion Flex J3i to be a useful plug and play solution for those who are looking to add additional storage to their &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; machines, and it's also cost effective. Sonnet charges &#36;199 for the Fusion Flex J3i, and while adding storage is expensive, it's still cheaper than buying Apple's higher-tier SSD storage options.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can get two 16TB 3.5-inch drives from Amazon for around &#36;800, for example, which gives you 32TB of storage for much less than the &#36;2,600 upgrade fee for the 8TB SSD from Apple. SSD storage is faster, of course, so if you want to go that route, you can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Inch-Internal-MZ-76E4T0B-AM/dp/B07864XY8B\">4TB SSDs</a> for somewhere around &#36;600 each, which still comes in cheaper than Apple's storage.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor our setup, we have a couple PCIe SSDs in the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; for video editing purposes, with the J3i on hand for storing larger files, RAW images, and video backups.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSonnet's Fusion Flex J3i can be <a href=\"https://www.sonnettech.com/product/fusion-flex-j3i/overview.html\">purchased from the Sonnet website</a> for &#36;199.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonnet/\">Sonnet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/08/sonnet-fusion-flex-j3i/\">Testing Sonnet&#039;s Fusion Flex J3i Mount With the Mac Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-sonnets-fusion-flex-j3i-mount-with-the-mac-pro.2244965/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KsFuUm8jzBk:wuKkKXev5BY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KsFuUm8jzBk:wuKkKXev5BY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KsFuUm8jzBk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
