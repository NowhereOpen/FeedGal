      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Lithium-ion batteries play a central role in the world of technology, powering everything from smartphones to smart cars, and one of the people who helped commercialize them says he has a way to cut mass production costs by 90% and significantly improve their safety. Hideaki Horie, formerly of Nissan Motor Co., founded Tokyo-based APB Corp. in 2018 to make \"all-polymer batteries\" -- hence the company name. The making of a cell, every battery's basic unit, is a complicated process requiring cleanroom conditions -- with airlocks to control moisture, constant air filtering and exacting precision to prevent contamination of highly reactive materials. The setup can be so expensive that a handful of top players like South Korea's LG Chem Ltd., China's CATL and Japan's Panasonic Corp. spend billions of dollars to build a suitable factory.\r\n \r\nHorie's innovation is to replace the battery's basic components -- metal-lined electrodes and liquid electrolytes -- with a resin construction. He says this approach dramatically simplifies and speeds up manufacturing, making it as easy as \"buttering toast.\" It allows for 10-meter-long battery sheets that can be stacked on top of each other \"like seat cushions\" to increase capacity, he said. Importantly, the resin-based batteries are also resistant to catching fire when punctured. In March, APB raised $74 million, which is tiny by the wider industry's standards but will be enough to fully equip one factory for mass production slated to start next year. Horie estimates the funds will get his plant in central Japan to 1 gigawatt-hour capacity by 2023.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\r\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Power+Pioneer+Invents+New+Battery+That's+90%25+Cheaper+Than+Lithium-Ion%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3gK9VFA\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\r\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F20%2F07%2F09%2F2117226%2Fpower-pioneer-invents-new-battery-thats-90-cheaper-than-lithium-ion%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/20/07/09/2117226/power-pioneer-invents-new-battery-thats-90-cheaper-than-lithium-ion?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=16743594&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/7RMUHMufyvk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

The restrictions would end 90 days after Portland's state of emergency order lifts. No date has been set to lift the order, which has been in place since March 12.

From a report: The internet giant encouraged employees to check colleagues' ID badges on campus, and asked security staff to do the same. This went beyond the typical corporate office system where workers swipe badges to enter. The policy was designed to prevent unauthorized visitors and keep Google's open work areas safe. But some staffers told management that Black and Latinx workers had their badges checked more often than other employees, according to the people, who experienced this themselves or saw friends and colleagues go through it. As a result, these employees felt policed on campus in a similar way that they are under suspicion elsewhere in life, said the people, who weren't authorized to speak publicly about the issue. It's an example of the unconscious, or overlooked, biases that make working in Silicon Valley harder for minorities, the people added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "content": "Trying to get an up close and personal look at the solar system's gas giants is a tricky and dangerous journey. From a report: Jupiter, like the other gas giants, doesn't have a rocky surface, but that doesn't mean it's just a massive cloud floating through the vacuum of space. It's made up of mostly helium and hydrogen, and as you move from the outer layers of the atmosphere toward the deeper parts, that gas grows denser and the pressures become more extreme. Temperatures quickly rise. In 1995, NASA's Galileo mission sent a probe into Jupiter's atmosphere; it broke up at about 75 miles in depth. Pressures here are over 100 times more intense than anything on Earth. At the innermost layers of Jupiter that are 13,000 miles deep, the pressure is 2 million times stronger than what's experienced at sea level on Earth, and temperatures are hotter than the sun's surface. \r\n\r\nSo clearly, no human is going to be able to venture too far down into Jupiter's depths. But would it be safe to simply orbit the planet? Perhaps we could establish an orbital space station, right? Well, there's another big problem when it comes to Jupiter: radiation. The biggest planet in the solar system also boasts its most powerful magnetosphere. These magnetic fields charge up particles in the vicinity, accelerating them to extreme speeds that can fry a spacecraft's electronics in moments. Spaceflight engineers have to figure out an orbit and spacecraft design that will reduce the exposure to this radiation. NASA figured this out with the triple-arrayed, perpetually spinning Juno spacecraft, but it doesn't look as if this would be a feasible design for a human spacecraft. Instead, for a crewed spacecraft to safely orbit or fly past Jupiter, it would have to keep a pretty significant distance away from the planet.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\r\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Will+Astronauts+Ever+Visit+Gas+Giants+Like+Jupiter%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2O9IeKb\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\r\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F20%2F07%2F09%2F1827252%2Fwill-astronauts-ever-visit-gas-giants-like-jupiter%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/20/07/09/1827252/will-astronauts-ever-visit-gas-giants-like-jupiter?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=16743010&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/GMTpJQNUn2Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
