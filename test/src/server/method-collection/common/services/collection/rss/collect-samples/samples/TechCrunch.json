      "content:encoded": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. is &#8220;looking at&#8221; banning Chinese social media apps, including the Chinese-owned company <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> comparing it to other Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE that have been deemed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/fcc-huawei-zte-national-security/\">national security threats</a> by the current administration. &#8220;With respect to Chinese apps on people&#8217;s cell phones, I can assure you that the United States will get this one right, too,&#8221; Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/pompeo-says-the-us-is-looking-at-banning-tiktok/5D143130-C870-4AD6-9F11-FE65225171A2.html\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>The fear is the app could be used to surveil or influence Americans, or else that TikTok parent ByteDance could be made to provide the Chinese government with TikTok&#8217;s data on its U.S.-based users &#8212; of which there are at least <a href=\"https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-2-billion\">165 million</a>. India, calling TikTok a &#8220;threat to sovereignty and integrity,&#8221; decided to ban the app late last week, saying it had similar concerns.</p>\n<p>Though security experts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tech/tiktok-security-threat/index.html\">disagree</a> over how concerned the U.S. should be about TikTok, the move would would undoubtedly hobble what has become one of the fastest-growing social media businesses on the planet, with <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-stats/\">800 million monthly active users</a> worldwide, half of whom are under age 24. In the meantime, the mere suggestion of a ban is proving a boon to TikTok&#8217;s biggest rival, Facebook &#8212; and notably at a time when the U.S. company faces <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/tech/facebook-civil-rights-audit/index.html\">growing scrutiny</a> over its decision not to take action on multiple controversial posts from Donald Trump.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The threat is already prompting some to speculate that Pompeo&#8217;s warning was politically motivated. In a <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/axios-re-cap/id1412162689\">new interview</a> with Axios, for example, L.A.-based talent manager John Shahidi observes that TikTok users have said they were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html\">partially responsible</a> for a Trump rally in Oklahoma two weeks ago that failed to deliver huge crowds.</p>\n<p>Shahidi &#8212; whose agency currently oversees nine &#8220;channels&#8221; on TikTok that collectively enjoy than 100 million followers &#8212; doesn&#8217;t doubt the two are related. &#8220;I&#8217;m on TikTok a lot,&#8221; Shahidi says, and &#8220;there are no Trump supporters, no official Trump account; no one who is from his team is on TikTok.&#8221; Is it &#8220;just coincidence that we&#8217;re heading toward [the election], and the one app that doesn&#8217;t support him &#8212; with everything happening in the world &#8212; we&#8217;re going to talk about taking down TikTok?&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p><strong>A shifting landscape</strong></p>\n<p>Either way, TikTok influencers are more actively promoting their other social media channels, including <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Instagram, to their followers as a kind of contingency plan. Soon to join them is rising social media star Pierson Wodzynski, a 21-year-old who ran track in high school and was taking a break from studying communications in college when, in January, a friend invited her to participate in a show on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AwesomenessTV\">AwesomenessTV</a>, a YouTube channel that has more than 8 million subscribers.</p>\n<p>The show&#8217;s set-up centered around nabbing a date with social media star Brent Rivera, who has 13 million <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"youtube\">YouTube <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> subscribers, 19.8 million Instagram followers, and more than 30 million TikTok fans.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Wodzynski found herself with the L.A.-based talent agency that Rivera cofounded two years ago called <a href=\"https://www.ampstudios.co/\">Amp Studios </a>and in recent months, aided by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6sU8TyJ6x0\">special guest appearances</a> by Rivera, she has built a substantial fanbase herself, with 500,000 subscribers on YouTube, 455,000 Instagram followers, and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pierson?lang=en\">4.1 million</a> fans on TikTok.</p>\n<p>Wodzynski says her followers seem to like the comedy bits she develops, such a recent series on the &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pierson/video/6787614014768811270\">things that go wrong when you&#8217;re running late</a>,&#8221; and another on the &#8220;Appdashians,&#8221; wherein each character she plays is a different social media company. (Notably, Facebook is the <a href=\"https://exolyt.com/user/piersonwodzynski/video/6832761088921177349\">old grandmother character</a>.)  Says Wodzynski, who comes across as both confident and affable, &#8220;I&#8217;m so unbelievably myself [on social media], it&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Little wonder that she&#8217;s concerned about the TikTok&#8217;s future in the U.S. Partly, she simply enjoys it. (&#8220;It&#8217;s just a great app to escape, and it&#8217;s so different, with a vast music library and editing software that other apps don&#8217;t have.&#8221;) But it&#8217;s also the source of most of her income, she says, explaining that she helps promote the brands with which Amp Studios works, including Chipotle. (&#8220;A lot of times, it&#8217;s me dancing to a popular song and holding the product, or developing a creative advertisement so it looks enjoyable.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Wodzynski says she is &#8220;ready for anything,&#8221; and that if the U.S. bans the platform, she trusts it will do so for legitimate reasons. Besides, she says, &#8220;There are many other roads to take your content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a sentiment that&#8217;s echoed by Max Levine, who cofounded Amp with Rivera, and who advises all of the firm&#8217;s talent to diversify across social platforms. &#8220;Diversify is a good mantra for life,&#8221; says Levine, who learned this lesson early when Vine &#8212; the once-popular video app that Twitter acquired, then subsequently shut down &#8212; &#8220;fizzled and died.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Land and expand</strong></p>\n<p>Levine points to early Vine stars like Logan Paul and Rivera himself who &#8220;were smart and focused on building platforms on Instagram and YouTube&#8221; and who not only emerged unscathed when Vine was shuttered but whose popularity ballooned afterward. He says that Amp&#8217;s clients have always &#8220;promoted other socials on TikTok,&#8221; and that he&#8217;d prefer that they not start becoming too aggressive on this front. &#8220;I think if every other TikTok mentions [a call to action], it could be a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yet it&#8217;s starting to happen, and with the threat of a ban in the air, Wodzynski &#8212; who says she saw her view count go down with India&#8217;s recent ban of TikTok &#8212; isn&#8217;t immune to the impulse. &#8220;Actually, later today I will be posting something on Tiktok about this whole banning thing and reminding people that if they want to follow my Instagram and Youtube that &#8216;this is what I post there,'&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do that pretty regularly, but I’m going to step it up in more in the coming days and weeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Facebook will be ready. Yesterday in India, Instagram <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/tech/instagram-reels-india-tiktok-ban/index.html\">rolled out a video-sharing feature</a> called Reels to fill the void left by TikTok that sounds very much like a clone. The in-app tool invites users to record 15-second videos set to music and audio, then upload them to their stories.</p>\n<p>As CNN notes, Facebook began testing the feature in Brazil last November. The feature is now available in France and Germany, too.</p>\n<p>Indeed, though Tiktok was not India&#8217;s sole target  &#8212; it also indefinitely banned 58 other apps and services <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/what-indias-tiktok-ban-means-for-china/\">provided by Chinese-based firms</a>, including Tencent&#8217;s WeChat &#8212; the country&#8217;s government enjoys a good relationship with Facebook, which recently <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ril-says-jio-platforms-received-rs-43754-crore-from-facebook-unit-for-9-99-stake/articleshow/76840861.cms\">nabbed a 10% stake</a> in local telecom giant Jio Platforms. In fact, in February, before a trip to India, Donald Trump talked about Facebook and the ranking that both he and India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi enjoy on the platform.</p>\n<p>He said Modi is &#8220;number two&#8221; on Facebook in terms of followers, and that he is number one as <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/representing-1-5-billion-people-modi-has-an-advantage-on-facebook-trump/articleshow/74235664.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst\">told to him directly</a> by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>As reported in the Economic Times, Trump said at the time: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to India next week, and we&#8217;re talking about &#8212; you know, they have 1.5 billion people. And Prime Minister Modi is number two on Facebook, number two. Think of that. You know who number one is? Trump. You believe that? Number one. I just found out.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1WMHGx283OM:mEtuUdjjmiI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/1WMHGx283OM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

It&#8217;s not a huge bump, mind, but at 2.8% year-over-year, it’s a notable increase after a rough first quarter. There are a couple of reasons for the growth here. First is the aforementioned interest in upgrading home setups for work and school. Second is from retailers, which have reopened in a number of locations and have begun to refill shelves after being cut off via the supply chain.</span></p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2014093\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2014093\" class=\"wp-image-2014093 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png 1402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png?resize=300,116 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png?resize=768,298 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png?resize=680,264 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-4.54.59-PM.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2014093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Gartner</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lenovo stayed at the number one spot, with HP following close behind.

The charges specifically pertain to goods and services sent to people located in Crimea, Iran and Syria, which are covered by Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, between November 2011 and October 2018. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Treasury Department also states that the retail giant failed to report “several hundred&#8221; transactions in a timely manner. The department adds: </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon also accepted and processed orders on its websites for persons located in or employed by the foreign missions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Additionally, Amazon accepted and processed orders from persons listed on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”) who were blocked pursuant to the Narcotics Trafficking Sanctions Regulations, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, the Transnational Criminal Organizations Sanctions Regulations, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sanctions Regulations, the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations, the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations, the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The settlement is, of course, fairly insubstantial, compared to the massive market cap of the online retail giant. The transactions, were, however, for fairly low-level retail goods and services. In all, the violations only amounted to around double the settlement price of $134,523. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The department doesn’t believe there was anything malicious going on, rather an issue with Amazon’s system, which failed to flag shipments to sanctioned areas. There appear to be a number of reasons this occurred.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>One example involves the site failing to note when product was shipped to the Iranian embassy in a different country.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amazon opted not to offer a comment on the story, though the company notably self-disclosed what it believed to be potential violations of the aforementioned laws back in July of 2016. As The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-settles-allegations-of-u-s-sanctions-violations-11594252099\">notes,</a> a number of other tech giants have been hit with similar issues.

      "content:encoded": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Harley-Davidson, the storied and struggling Milwaukee-based company that last year launched its first production electric motorcycle in an effort to reboot sales and appeal to a younger customer base, is cutting 700 jobs from its global operations. About 500 workers will be laid off before the end of the year, the company said Thursday.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s CFO John Olin is also out, effective immediately. Harley-Davidson&#8217;s current VP Treasurer Darrell Thomas has taken over as interim CFO until a successor is appointed. &#8220;Significant changes are necessary, and we must move in new directions,&#8221; Harley-Davidson chairman, president and CEO <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/09/2060116/0/en/Harley-Davidson-Announces-Rewire-Progress-New-Operating-Model-and-Leaner-Organization-to-Drive-Focus-and-Efficiency.html\">Jochen Zeitz said in a statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Harley-Davidson has branded its job cuts and restructuring plan &#8220;The Rewire,&#8221; which Zeitz spoke about in the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings call back in April. At the time, Zeitz said the company was still committed to its other strategic plan known as <a href=\"https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/about-us/more-roads.html\">&#8220;More Roads&#8221;</a> that aimed to make the manufacturer an accessible, global brand through marketing and dealership initiatives and a series of new products that included small-displacement motorcycles for Asia markets and EVs, starting with the LiveWire.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Still, Zeitz declared back in April it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a result of my observations and assessment, I&#8217;ve concluded that we need to take significant actions and rewire the company now in terms of priorities, execution, operating model and strategy to drive sustained profit and long-term growth,&#8221; he said in April. &#8220;We are calling it The Rewire. And it&#8217;s our playbook for the next few months, leading to a new five-year strategic plan, which we will share when visibility to the future returns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Visibility into the future has apparently returned, and in Harley-Davidson&#8217;s view it&#8217;s time to cut costs and possibly get back to its core products. Initial Rewire actions are expected to result in restructuring costs of about $42 million in the second quarter of 2020, Harley-Davidson said in its announcement Thursday. The company plans to share a summary of The Rewire, including additional costs and expected savings, when it releases its Q2 results. The Rewire will set the foundation for a new 2021-2025 strategic plan, which is expected to be shared in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Harley-Davidson has seen its sales drop in recent years in the U.S., its largest market, as its core Baby Boomer customers have gotten older. The COVID-19 pandemic dampened sales further and the company has already cut back production, which resulted in dozens of job cuts last month at its factories in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The push into EVs and products for Asian countries aimed to expand into new markets and breathe new life into Harley-Davidson.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear how &#8220;The Rewire&#8221; might affect the company&#8217;s push into EVs. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The LiveWire, which launched </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">last fall, was supposed to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/inside-harley-davidsons-ev-shift-with-a-ride-on-its-livewire/\">lead a future line-up of EVs</a> planned by Harley-Davidson — spanning motorcycles, bicycles and scooters. Harley-Davidson has not responded to a request for comment; TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.</span></p>\n<p>The statement from <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Harley-Davidson</span> makes no specific mention of EVs. It only said the key elements of its restructuring plan were to enhance core strengths and better balance expansion into new spaces, prioritize the markets that matter, reset product launches and build up its accessories and merchandising businesses.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hUdbQouqjvI:EkK3hohwcA4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hUdbQouqjvI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

On July 13, Apple will begin offering <a href=\"http://apple.co/developinswiftexplorationspl\">free online training</a> to educators that will serve as an introduction to its Develop in Swift curriculum.</p>\n<p>This curriculum has also been completely redesigned to meet students learning styles, based on user feedback, says Apple.</p>\n<p>The new series will now include four books, &#8220;Develop in Swift Explorations,&#8221; &#8220;Develop in Swift AP CS Principles,&#8221; and &#8220;Develop in Swift Fundamentals,&#8221; all of which are available today.

Plus, there are resources on Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/education/k12/learning-from-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learning from Home website</a>, launched this spring. The site includes on-demand videos and virtual conferences on remote learning, and options to schedule free one-on-one virtual coaching sessions, hosted by educators at Apple.</p>\n<p>The long-term impacts of Apple&#8217;s push for increased coding education still remain to be seen. &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; was only launched in 2016, for example, and the &#8220;Develop in Swift&#8221; curriculum arrived just last year. Combined, the programs today reach 9,000 schools and higher education institutions worldwide.</p>\n<p>The idea that &#8220;everyone&#8221; can and should learn to code is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/\">still somewhat controversial</a>. While many may be able to learn coding fundamentals, not everyone will enjoy coding or excel at it. Plus, people often turn to coding <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools\">for the wrong reasons</a> or get duped by coding bootcamps into thinking that a few weeks of training will have them sailing into six-figure careers with ease.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, exposing more kids to coding concepts may help to uncover the potential talent and interest in programming that would have otherwise been overlooked. That interest can then be nurtured by future courses and education as the child grows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple has worked alongside educators for 40 years, and we’re especially proud to see how Develop in Swift and Everyone Can Code have been instrumental in helping teachers and students make an impact in their communities,&#8221; said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Markets, Apps and Services, in a statement. &#8220;We’ve seen community college students build food security apps for their campus and watched middle school educators host virtual coding clubs over summer break. As part of our commitment to help expand access to computer science education, we are thrilled to be adding a new professional learning course to help more educators, regardless of their experience, have the opportunity to learn coding and teach the next generation of developers and designers,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=s4vzir2Giuo:uW3m3fxI7yY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/s4vzir2Giuo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Late last year, SF-based <a href=\"https://yur.fit/\">YUR</a> raised $1.1 million in pre-seed funding for their VR exercise software.</p>\n<p>The virtual reality market has had a lot to gain from shelter-in-place, but supply chain problems with the industry&#8217;s top backer, Oculus, left VR studios with plenty of missed opportunities. All of Oculus&#8217;s headsets, including its $399 standalone Quest headset, have been sold out or in low supply since the beginning of the year, a development that has negatively impacted the growth of an industry that is increasingly reliant on Facebook.</p>\n<p>VR headsets don&#8217;t have heart rate monitors or other fitness-tracking capabilities, but VR developers do have access to plenty of motion data from how much and how quickly a user&#8217;s headset and controllers are moving.</p>\n<p>FitXR uses this data to calculate calories burned and lets users set personal goals for how many calories they&#8217;d like to burn in-app on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>For now, FitXR&#8217;s BoxVR sits solely inside the VR headset, but as the company looks to scale its team of 20 further with this funding, the company&#8217;s leadership is teasing an interest in having its world grow beyond the headset.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We look at our own usage of the product and we don&#8217;t think it should be constrained to virtual reality,&#8221; FitXR CEO Sam Cole told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I think the sticking point for us is that we believe the most fun way to work out is in a VR headset. And therefore the strong focus from us as a company is to continue to build and innovate in that space.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=dYm4yx6FNMY:8u4eUMTYuMo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/dYm4yx6FNMY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Described as the world’s first mobile internet company, Sendit was acquired by Microsoft in 1999.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>He joined EQT a decade ago to help establish its venture arm, when Europe barely had a venture capital ecosystem and was dwarfed by the U.S. in terms of available capital. <a href=\"https://medium.com/eqtventures/eqt-ventures-ii-660m-to-support-the-next-generation-of-global-winners-e3ac86405d33\">In late 2019</a>, EQT Ventures raised its second fund, with commitments totaling €660 million, making it one of the largest VC funds in Europe.</p>\n<p>One of the firm&#8217;s investments, Small Giant Games, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/zynga-to-acquire-small-giant-games-the-maker-of-empires-puzzles-for-700m/\">was acquired by Zynga</a> in 2018 in a deal valued at $700 million. Other portfolio companies include 3D Hubs, Varjo, Natural Cycles, Permutive, Codacy, Peakon and Tinyclues.</p>\n<p>Confirming Winbladh&#8217;s departure, EQT&#8217;s Head of Communications, Nina Nornholm, provided the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hjalmar has been with EQT for almost 10 years and has played an instrumental role on our digital transformation journey. Over the last five years, he has also built and led the Ventures team into a very successful business and with a strong portfolio and dedicated team. He is now longing to get back to his entrepreneurial roots and has decided to leave his role within EQT Ventures.

With the tech landscape more competitive than ever, he wants to create a way for seasoned entrepreneurs and investors like himself to better support the next generation of founders, hinting at something earlier stage than EQT Ventures&#8217; Series A, B and C focus. However, he said he wasn&#8217;t currently raising a fund of his own.</p>\n<p>As always, watch this space.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=B7ZuhGGdBP4:RO7kSsokAYg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/B7ZuhGGdBP4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

I’ve been playing around with beta versions of iOS 14 and here’s what you should expect when you update your iPhone to the final release of iOS 14 this fall.</p>\n<p>The most interesting change is something you’re not going to notice at first. The home screen has been rethought. In some ways, the iPhone now works more like Android devices. You can add widgets to the home screen and there’s a new app launcher called the App Library.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been using a smartphone for many years, chances are your device is cluttered with a dozen apps you frequently use, some apps you only need a few times a year and a ton of apps that are no longer useful.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Maybe your home screen is perfectly organized and you’re thinking that this doesn’t apply to you. Arguably, you’re part of the minority. Many people tell me they don’t even know where app icons are located anymore and they just pull down to use the search feature.</p>\n<p>With iOS 14, changes are not immediately visible. If you want to keep using your phone just like before, nobody is stopping you. But the home screen is now more customizable.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2006340\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2006340\" class=\"wp-image-2006340 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/smart-widg.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"575\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2006340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<p>When you tap and hold on a home screen icon, there’s a new menu that lists all the widgets you can install on your home screen. Many default apps already support widgets, such as Reminders, Calendar, Stock, Weather, Music, etc. And each widget comes in multiple sizes if you want to see more or less info.</p>\n<p>The most interesting thing about widgets is that you can stack them and flip through them. Otherwise, they’d quickly take over your entire home screen. Apple also tries to surface the widget that is more relevant to the time of the day and what you’re doing.</p>\n<p>The second big change with the home screen is that there’s a new page at the right of your last page. The App Library groups all your apps on your phone by category. Some icons are bigger than others as Apple tries once again to surface the most important apps to you.</p>\n<p>In my experience, categories don’t work that well as they’re based on the broad categories of the App Store. But you can always tap on the search bar at the top to display an alphabetical list of your apps. It could be useful if you can’t remember the name of an app, for instance.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2006354\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2006354\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2006354\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png 2228w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=2048,1171 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.08.50-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2006354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<h2>Fighting app fatigue</h2>\n<p>Those changes for the home screen might seem minor, but they are important to change the current app paradigm. People simply don’t want to download new apps. They don’t want to create a new account and they don’t want to have another icon.</p>\n<p>Now that you can hide pages of apps and that there’s the App Library, downloading new apps has become less intimidating. If you combine that with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/\">Sign in with Apple</a>, you can go from no app to interacting with content in no time.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, Apple is introducing App Clips. They are sort of mini apps that you can launch without installing an app. It’s a small part of an app that you can easily share. I haven’t had the chance to try it out yet as third-party developers have yet to take advantage of App Clips.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to share App Clips. You can launch those apps from the web, from Messages, from Maps, from NFC tags or from QR codes. Get ready to see stickers at cafés, on scooters or in museums. Scan a code or tap your phone on it and you get an app-like experience. If you want to dive deeper, you can download the full app from the App Library.</p>\n<p>But it’s also going to have some major impacts on utility apps, apps that you don’t use that often or travel apps for instance. Sure, you may keep your favorite social app on your home screen. But you’re going to forget about apps that only live in the App Library.</p>\n<p>Developers will be happy that downloading apps is easier. And yet, it is going to be harder to make people come back to your app after the first launch.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2006361\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2006361\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2006361\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png 2246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-22-at-1.30.36-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2006361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<h2>Some app refinements</h2>\n<p>Let me list some quality-of-life improvements that are going to make your phone work better. In Messages, you can now pin conversations to the top. Group conversations are also receiving a major update with the ability to @-mention people, reply to specific messages and set a group of photos. Once again, Apple is bringing Messages closer to WhatsApp and Telegram. But it’s not a bad thing.</p>\n<p>In Maps, there are many new features that I already detailed in a separate post. I encourage you to read it if you want to learn more about guides, electric vehicle routing, cycling directions and more.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0IRGmXMiXa\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/apple-maps-to-tell-you-refine-location-by-scanning-the-skyline/\">Apple Maps to tell you to refine location by scanning the skyline</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Apple Maps to tell you to refine location by scanning the skyline&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/apple-maps-to-tell-you-refine-location-by-scanning-the-skyline/embed/#?secret=0IRGmXMiXa\" data-secret=\"0IRGmXMiXa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The Home app has been improved with a new row of icons that describe the status of your home. For instance, you can see the temperature, see if a door is open, see if lights are on, etc.</p>\n<p>Like every year, Notes and Reminders are getting some small improvements. For instance, document scanning has been improved, search has been improved, you can assign reminders to others and more. Those apps have become really powerful with these small incremental updates.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2006648\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2006648\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2006648\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg 2258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/imessage-ios14.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2006648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>\n<h2>All the rest</h2>\n<p>There are many things that I haven’t mentioned yet or that I haven’t tried because I can’t use those features yet. Similarly, it’ll take some time before developers start adopting those features. Here’s a quick rundown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incoming calls don’t take over the entire screen anymore. You get a notification at the top of the screen, which is so much better if you don’t want to answer a call.</li>\n<li>Similarly, Siri doesn’t overtake the screen. Your display fades out. I think more people are going to use Siri because of this as it doesn’t feel as invasive.</li>\n<li>Your AirPods will automatically switch between your iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.</li>\n<li>When you’re on a FaceTime call or watching a video, you can switch to another app and keep the video in a corner. There’s not much else to say other than it’s nice.</li>\n<li>Cycling directions in Apple Maps: I’m a bike lover, but the feature isn’t available in Paris. It’s hard to know whether directions make sense in San Francisco or New York as I don’t know cycling infrastructure that well in those cities.</li>\n<li>When you pull down to search for something, iOS now automatically highlights the first result. You can tap Go on the keyboard to hit the first result. It’s so much better.</li>\n<li>HomeKit-compatible security cameras can now recognize faces based on tags in Photos.</li>\n<li>You can unlock cars with your phone using NFC if you have a compatible car.</li>\n<li>Following the acquisition of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-dark-sky-android-version-shutting-down-in-july/\">Dark Sky</a>, you’ll be able to see next-hour precipitation in Apple’s Weather app.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll be able to choose a different web browser and email client as default apps with iOS 14.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What about stability?</h2>\n<p>The big issue of iOS 13 was that it was quite buggy when it launched in September 2019. It’s hard to know whether iOS 14 is going to perform better on this front as it’s still a beta.</p>\n<p>But, as you can see, Apple didn’t try to reinvent the wheel with default apps. There are a ton of improvements across the board, but no big redesign of Photos or Messages for instance. And I think it’s a good thing.</p>\n<p>Changes on the home screen as well as App Clips could have wider implications for developers. It could change the way you discover and install apps today. So it’s going to be interesting to see if the developer community embraces App Clips.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=2VpO0wRGiWE:9rgaT_xmxEo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/2VpO0wRGiWE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Unlike developer betas, everyone can download these betas without a $99 developer account. But don’t forget, it’s a beta.</p>\n<p>The company still plans to release the final version of iOS and iPadOS 14.0 this fall. But Apple is going to release betas every few weeks over the summer. It’s a good way to fix as many bugs as possible and gather data from a large group of users.</p>\n<p>As always, Apple’s public betas closely follow the release cycle of developer betas. And Apple released the second developer beta of iOS and iPadOS 14 earlier this week. So it sounds like the first public beta is more or less the same build as the second developer build.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>But remember, you shouldn’t install an iOS beta on your primary iPhone or iPad. The issue is not just bugs — some apps and features won’t work at all. In some rare cases, beta software can also brick your device and make it unusable. You may even lose data on iCloud. Proceed with extreme caution.</p>\n<p>But if you have an iPad or iPhone you don’t need, here’s how to download it. Head over to Apple’s <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">beta website</a> and download the configuration profile. It’s a tiny file that tells your iPhone or iPad to update to public betas like it’s a normal software update.</p>\n<p>You can either download the configuration profile from Safari on your iOS device directly, or transfer it to your device using AirDrop, for instance. Reboot your device, then head over to the Settings app. In September, your device should automatically update to the final version of iOS and iPadOS 13 and you’ll be able to delete the configuration profile.</p>\n<p>The biggest change of iOS 14 is the introduction of widgets on the home screen, a new App Library to browse all your apps and the ability to run App Clips — those are mini apps that feature a small part of an app and that you can run without installing anything.</p>\n<p>There are also many refinements across the board, such as new features for Messages, with a big focus on groups with @-mentions and replies, a new Translate app that works on your device, cycling directions in Apple Maps in some cities and various improvements in Notes, Reminders, Weather, Home and more.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about iOS 14, I looked at some of the features in the new version:</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3DRF3UhrMn\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/ios-14-gets-rid-of-the-app-grid-to-help-you-find-the-app-youre-looking-for/\">iOS 14 gets rid of the app grid to help you find the app you&#8217;re looking for</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;iOS 14 gets rid of the app grid to help you find the app you&#8217;re looking for&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/ios-14-gets-rid-of-the-app-grid-to-help-you-find-the-app-youre-looking-for/embed/#?secret=3DRF3UhrMn\" data-secret=\"3DRF3UhrMn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ScOhWqSm7wc:qqxPb_pAJ8s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ScOhWqSm7wc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

The homework gap that separates those with strong connections from those on the wrong side of the digital divide will become a homework chasm without drastic and immediate intervention.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>To raise awareness of the enormity and immediacy of the digital divide, I started <a href=\"https://www.neighbors4nonprofits.org/\">No One Left Offline</a> (NOLO) in San Francisco. It’s an all-volunteer nonprofit that’s creating a coalition of Bay Area organizations focused on giving students, seniors and individuals with disabilities access to high-speed, affordable Internet.</p>\n<p>During the week of July 27, the NOLO coalition will launch the Bridge the Divide campaign to raise $50,000 in funds that will be used to directly cover broadband bills for families on the edge of the digital divide.</p>\n<p>At this point in our response to COVID-19, emergency measures have only stopped the homework gap from growing rather than actually shrinking it. That’s precisely why we need a new form of addressing students’ lack of adequate internet and devices. The digital “haves” should embrace directly covering the broadband bills and upgrades required by the “have nots.” This form of direct giving is both the most effective and efficient means of giving every student high-speed internet and a device to make the most of that connection.</p>\n<p>But too few people are aware of just how dire life can be on the wrong side of the digital divide. That’s why I’m hoping you &#8212; as a fellow member of the digital “haves” &#8212; will join me in taking a day off(line) on July 17. I’m convinced that it will take a day (if not more) in the digital dark for more Americans to recognize just how difficult it is to thrive, let alone survive, without stable internet, a device and a sufficient level of digital literacy.</p>\n<p>The increased attention to the digital divide generated by this day off(line) will spur a more collective and significant response to stopping the formation of a homework chasm.</p>\n<p>Current efforts to close the homework gap have at once been laudable and limited. For example, internet service providers (ISPs) deserve praise for taking a voluntary pledge to limit fees, forgive fines and remove data caps. But that pledge expired at the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/end-of-broadband-pledge-could-cut-lifelines-for-families-acb65709-68cb-4b4d-90e5-546725d2d51b.html\">end of June,</a> months before school starts and in the middle of an expanding economic calamity.</p>\n<p>It’s true that many ISPs are still going to extraordinary lengths to help those in need &#8212; look no further than Verizon donating phones to Miracle Messages to help individuals experiencing homelessness connect with loved ones. However, even these extraordinary measures will not fully make up for the fact that hundreds of thousands of Californians are experiencing greater financial insecurity than ever before. They want and require a long-term solution to their digital needs &#8212; not just voluntary pledges that end in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\n<p>In the same way, many school districts in the Bay Area have rapidly loaned hotspots and devices to students and families in need. In fact, even before COVID-19, the Oakland Unified School District and the 1Million Project were providing hotspots to students in need. These sorts of interventions, though, do not afford students on the wrong side of the homework gap the same opportunity to fully develop their digital literacy as those that have devices to call their own and internet connections sufficient to do more than just homework.</p>\n<p>Every student deserves a device to call their own and a connection that allows them to become experts in safely and smoothly navigating the internet.</p>\n<p>Direct giving is the solution. Financially secure individuals across the Bay Area can and should &#8220;sponsor&#8221; internet plans and devices for families in need. By sponsoring a family’s high-speed internet plan for a year or more, donors will provide students and parents alike with the security they need to focus on all of the other challenges associated with life in a pandemic. What’s more, sponsored devices would come without strings attached or &#8220;used&#8221; labels.</p>\n<p>Students would have a fully equipped laptop to call their own as well as one that didn’t lack key functionalities, which is common among donated devices.</p>\n<p>Because access to the internet is a human right, the government should be solving the homework gap. So far, it hasn’t been up to the task. So, in the interim, we’ll need a private sector solution. The good news is that we collectively seem up for the task. <a href=\"https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/insights/how-covid-19-is-shifting-donor-giving.html\">According to Fidelity</a>, most charitable donors plan to maintain or increase their giving this year.</p>\n<p>Consider that even 46% of millennials plan to increase their philanthropy. Unfortunately, one inhibitor to giving is the fact that &#8220;many donors don&#8217;t feel that they have the information they need to effectively support efforts&#8221; to address the ramifications of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>That’s where NOLO and other digital inclusion coalitions step in. We’re sounding the bell: The public sector isn’t closing the homework gap; it’s on us to make sure kids have the connections and devices they need to thrive. NOLO is also providing the means to act on this information &#8212; during its Bridge the Divide campaign, donors will have a chance to sponsor broadband bills for community members served by organizations across the Bay Area including the SF Tech Council, BMAGIC and the Mission Merchants Association.</p>\n<p>Our collective assignment is making the homework gap a priority. Our due date is nearing. The first task is taking a day off(line) on July 17. The next is donating to the Bridge the Divide campaign during the week of the 27th.</p>\n<p>Let’s get to work.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GmNYY3VS6lw:PYXIBveBSro:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/GmNYY3VS6lw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Asking the right questions at just the right moment can be the difference between signing a deal today (and saving those legal fees!) and losing a deal and ending up in a courtroom in the Eastern District of Texas.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2013764 size-medium\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Adam Zagaris\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Adam.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Given how critical this skill is, we’re excited to bring two seasoned and complementary attorneys to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-sf-2020?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=earlystagesf2020&amp;utm_content=contract&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=contract&amp;display=\">TC Early Stage on July 21 and 22</a> who are experts at the legal issues facing startups to offer their advice and answer your questions about how to think about business law and how to balance getting the right advice with the financial constraints of early-stage startups.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>James Alonso is founder and partner at <a href=\"https://www.magnolialaw.io\">Magnolia Law</a> where he specializes in company formation, venture financing and the law around scaling startups.

Meanwhile, a portion of the fund will also be set aside for follow-on funding for the most promising of its portfolio.</p>\n<p>Described as business model- and sector-agnostic, K Fund currently has a mix of B2B and B2C companies in its portfolio across a wide variety of sectors, such as travel, fintech, insurtech and others. They include online travel agency Exoticca, HR software Factorial, insurtech startup Bdeo and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/hubtype-raises-1-1m-to-help-developers-build-richer-chat-support/\">Hubtype</a>, a conversational messaging tech provider.</p>\n<p>I caught up with K Fund&#8217;s Jaime Novoa to delve deeper into the firm&#8217;s investment remit, how the Spanish startup and tech ecosystem has developed over the last few years and to learn more about &#8220;K Founders,&#8221; the VC&#8217;s new pre-seed funding program.</p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: K Fund’s first fund was announced in late 2016 to back startups in Spain with an international outlook at seed and Series A. At €70 million, this second fund is €20 million larger but I gather the remit remains broadly the same. Can you be more specific with regards to cheque size, geography, sector and the types of startups you look for?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jaime Novoa:</strong> We’re both agnostic in terms of business models and industries. Since our focus is, for the most part, Spain, we do not believe that the Spanish market is big enough to build a vertically focused fund, either in terms of business model or sector.</p>\n<p>With our first fund we invested in 28 companies, with a slightly larger number of B2B SaaS companies than B2C ones, and across a wide variety of sectors. We do have a bit of exposure to travel and fintech/insurtech, but that’s because we’ve found several interesting companies in those spaces, not because we proactively said, “let’s invest in fintech/travel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In terms of check sizes, the core of the fund will be to make the same type of investments as in our first fund: first cheques from €200k to €2m and then sufficient capital for follow-on rounds. We’ll probably do a similar number of deals compared to the previous fund, but we want to have additional capital for follow-on purposes.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=Z4rQ8d3_bgw:Qdrz6OK2I8A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/Z4rQ8d3_bgw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

Automation advocates like to point to the “three Ds” of dull, dirty and dangerous jobs that will eventually be replaced by a robotic workforce, but in the age of COVID-19, nearly any essential job qualifies. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The robotic invasion has already begun in earnest. The service, delivery, health care and sanitation industries in particular have all opened a massive gap over the past several months that automation has been more than happy to roll right through. A <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/24/the-robots-are-ready-as-the-covid-19-recession-spreads/\">recent report from The Brookings Institute</a> notes that automation arrives in the workforce in fits and starts — most notably, during times of economic downturn. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Robots’ infiltration of the workforce doesn’t occur at a steady, gradual pace. Instead, automation happens in bursts, concentrated especially in bad times such as in the wake of economic shocks, when humans become relatively more expensive as firms’ revenues rapidly decline,&#8221; the study found. &#8220;At these moments, employers shed less-skilled workers and replace them with technology and higher-skilled workers, which increases labor productivity as a recession tapers off.&#8221;<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9NX2lxWkiSM:irli_D025WI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9NX2lxWkiSM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
