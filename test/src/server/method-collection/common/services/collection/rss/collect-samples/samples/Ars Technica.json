Android 10's \"300 day\" mark was 10 days ago.</a> (credit: Google)</p></div>\n<p>Google today <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/accelerating-android-updates.html\">dropped a blog post</a> detailing its progress on improving the Android ecosystem's update speed. The company has been hard at work for the past few years modularizing Android, with the hope that making Android easier to update would result in device manufacturers pushing out updates faster. Google's efforts have been paying off, with the company announcing Android 10 has had the fastest rollout ever.</p>\n<p>The last few versions of Android have each brought a major improvement to Android's update system. Android 8 introduced Project Treble, which separated the OS from the hardware support, enabling easier porting of Android across devices. In Android 9 Pie, Google completed its work on Treble and started publishing Generic System Images (GSIs): drop-in versions of Android that work on any Project Treble-compatible device. Android 10 introduced Project Mainline and the new APEX file type designed for updatable lower-level system components, delivered through the Play Store.</p>\n<p>Google's stats show that all this work is actually improving the ecosystem. \"Thanks to these efforts,\" Google writes, \"the adoption of Android 10 has been faster than any previous versions of Android. Android 10 was running on 100 million devices 5 months post launch—28% faster than Android Pie.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690513#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690513&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DOCWZ93WaL4:qmfVsFRXfac:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

Jimmy is Promo did an excellent job, and by taking some Note 10+ comparison shots, we can clearly see the Note 20 Ultra is taller and wider than the Note 10+, which was already one of the biggest smartphones on the market.</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Note series is usually very close to the Galaxy S series released earlier in the year, and it looks like that's the case this year, too. Like the S20, the Note 20 goes with a curved front display and a hole punch front camera, with the one design change being taller corners. The rear camera block gets new styling with circles around each camera, making the lenses appear bigger than they really are. The camera layout looks identical to the Galaxy S20 Ultra, so expect the three big cameras to be a main camera, wide-angle lens, and a telephoto, followed by a tiny depth camera tucked away under the flash.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690428#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690428&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=9rxYJUCa-wI:_Jf2VQd6ylA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

But while $70 would match the high-water mark for <em>nominal</em> game pricing, it wouldn't be a historically high asking price in terms of <em>actual value</em>. Thanks to inflation and changes in game distribution, in fact, the current ceiling for game prices has never been lower.</p>\n<h2>The data</h2>\n<p>To measure how the actual asking price for console games has changed over time, we relied primarily on <a href=\"https://www.retrowaste.com/wp-content/gallery/1980s-video-games-ads/\">scanned catalogs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.retrowaste.com/wp-content/gallery/1990s-video-games-ads/\">retail advertising fliers</a> we found online. While this information was easier to find for some years than others, we were still able to gather data for 20 distinct years across the last four decades. We then adjusted those nominal prices to constant 2020 dollars using <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">the Bureau of Labor Statistics' CPI inflation calculator</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690243#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690243&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=NNJ0MWnf3lw:B07ZWzIu_r0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

While the lack of instant gratification is certainly frustrating, having some indications of progress could at least sustain patience with the energy transformation needed. The problem is that Earth’s climate system differs from that metaphorical huge ship in a key way—there is a significant amount of natural variability that can also mask a change in trend.</p>\n<p>So before we see any change in climate trends from our present actions, we have to both wait for them to start and wait for them to become large enough to be detectable against a background of natural variability.</p>\n<p>A new study led by <a href=\"https://www.cicero.oslo.no/en/employee/24/bjorn-hallvard-samset\">Bjørn Hallvard Samset</a> takes on the question of how long it will take to clearly see the effects of reducing emissions. “This paper is about managing our expectations,” the authors say in their new work. Failure of that management could mean that undertaking the work of climate mitigation would lose support if people are expecting instantaneous progress that doesn’t materialize.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690270#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690270&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=8kBlC1EAjrM:Y9sYkfI4qEQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

On Thursday, researchers with security firm Check Point said the <a href=\"link\">Joker has struck again</a>, this time lurking in 11 seemingly legitimate apps downloaded from Play about 500,000 times.

The surging interest in encrypted messaging comes days after the Chinese government in Beijing passed a new national security law that reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and could undermine its traditionally strong protections for civil liberties.</p>\n<p>The 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China came with a promise that China would respect Hong Kong's autonomy for 50 years following the handover. Under the terms of that deal, Hong Kong residents should have continued to enjoy greater freedom than people on the mainland until 2047. But recently, the mainland government has appeared to renege on that deal.</p>\n\n<p>Civil liberties advocates see the national security law approved last week as a major blow to freedom in Hong Kong. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html\">reports</a> that \"the four major offenses in the law—separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries—are ambiguously worded and give the authorities extensive power to target activists who criticize the party, activists say.\" Until now, Hong Kongers faced trial in the city's separate, independent judiciary. The new law opens the door for dissidents to be tried in mainland courts with less respect for civil liberties or due process.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690144#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690144&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=st4wFmzjdzY:iJ6Xv87PCPM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",

That sounds like a pretty left-field question for a Wednesday morning, we know. But it was sparked by a lengthy discussion in the Ars office this morning, and we figured it might be interesting to get your take on the issue, particularly since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/openzfs-removed-master-slave-terminology-from-its-codebase/\">the way we use language is under the spotlight</a> right now.</p>\n<p>Confession time: the debate was initiated by yours truly. I find it hard not to be pedantic, and since the actual names of the plants that people smoke (or vape, or eat) are <em>cannabis sativa</em> and <em>cannabis indica</em>, I think that's what we should use when we write about the topic at Ars. The word \"marijuana\" is also specific to North America, and while our audience is predominantly North American, it's not exclusively so.</p>\n<p>But there's another reason to drop \"marijuana\" from the style guide: <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/news/2016/04/13/23948555/the-word-marijuana-versus-the-word-cannabis\">in the 1930s there was a conscious, racist effort</a> by US government authorities to demonize the drug by associating it with Mexico.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690115#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1690115&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=ufvTrJrkGv8:CBuO_aIN1UA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>",
