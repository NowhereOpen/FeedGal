Going in with a plan will allow you to focus on the content of the event and your intentions each day, as opposed to wasting time frantically trying to decide what sessions you’re going to attend.</p>\n<h3>Choosing your sessions</h3>\n<p>Once you know what your intentions are and you have the event schedule, determine what will be the most beneficial content for you.

You may have a tight schedule and not be able to make anything past 3pm. If some of the sessions will be available after the conference, it may be worth checking out topics you wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Know when to take a break</h3>\n<p>When you’re planning out your schedule, you need to make sure you build in time for breaks. This means time to eat, time to decompress, time to refill your coffee cup, and time to do work or home stuff.</p>\n<p>Conferences usually have a lot of breaks and that’s for good reason. Ideally, you’re going to be learning a lot. But if you try to learn it all at once without giving your brain a break, very little of it will stick.</p>\n<p>So, be sure to listen to your body. If you start to feel foggy or overwhelmed, take a break, grab some water, and move around a bit.</p>\n<h3>Build in networking time</h3>\n<p>Something else you want to account for when planning your virtual event agenda is when you’re going to network. Some conferences will have time to network built in, but others won’t. </p>\n<p>You’ll want to dedicate time to get to know the other attendees by joining conversations and adding people on social media. This will look a bit different in the virtual space, as you won’t be meeting for coffee or chatting in the lobby, but try to stay creative!

Think back to what your intention was, what you did throughout the day to fulfill that intention, and what you can put into action moving forward. </p>\n<p>This is a great exercise to ensure you’re making the most out of the event. Far too often, we take in all of the information and do nothing with it! That’s why we like to suggest creating at least three action items at the end of each day.</p>\n<h2>Gather the essentials</h2>\n<ol></ol>\n<p>Okay, it’s the first day of the conference and you’re about to jump in front of the computer. BUT! Before you do that, you need to make sure you have everything you need to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Get a clean notebook or start a fresh doc</h3>\n<p>Having a clean slate for notes will help you stay focused while attending any conference (virtual or otherwise). So grab a new, crisp notebook or create a new document file on your computer before you get started. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/bring-your-best-self-to-online-conferences/5eff7c217a9f73.89660715.png\" width=\"405\" height=\"346\" data-image=\"no1whob2lay3\"></figure>\n<p>If you decide to go the computer route, be sure you close all other tabs and turn off notifications! You want to be sure that your attention stays on the conference.</p>\n<h4>Taking notes during a virtual conference</h4>\n<p>With that new notebook or document of yours, you’ll want to take the most effective notes possible. With that in mind, here are a few things to take note of:</p>\n<ul><li>What you learned</li><li>How can you apply it</li><li>What can you share with your team</li></ul>\n<p>To ensure that you’re on track to capture each of these things, when you go into each session, write your intention for the session at the top of your notes page. Then, divide your pages by “what I learned,” “how to apply,” and “what to share.” This will keep your notes nice and organized and give you a visual cue on whether or not you’re getting what you expected out of the session. It will also make your end-of-day recap much easier.</p>\n<p>When it comes to virtual events, one of the biggest benefits is that you often get the slide decks and video bundles afterward. We suggest finding out whether the event you’re attending offers those things before you start taking notes, as it may lighten your note-taking burden a bit.</p>\n<h3>Have some snacks, water, and coffee (or tea)</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most important things to have during a virtual conference are the snacks and drinks! As you know, at MozCon, we take this part very seriously, so we expect nothing less if you attend our virtual event.</p>\n<p>Brain food can help you stay focused. Some of our favorite snacks are granola bars, nuts, veggies, and of course, donuts.

All that’s left is showing up. With virtual events, this can be hard to do. Especially if you know that the content is going to be available after the event is over. But there is so much to be gained by being a part of the live event and the conversations happening around it.</p>\n<p>So show up, and show out! </p>\n<p>PS: If you’re looking for a virtual event to attend this year, Roger is still hoping to give you a virtual hug at MozCon Virtual 2020.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/mozcon/register?promo=mv20-videogear&tr=true\" class=\"button-primary large-cta blue\">Join us for MozCon Virtual!</a></p><br /><p><a href=\"https://moz.com/moztop10\">Sign up for The Moz Top 10</a>, a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

However, it's a complex subject that tends to be very technical. What are the most crucial things to understand about your site's page speed, and how can you begin to improve? To help you answer these questions, we're sharing this popular episode of Whiteboard Friday (originally published in February 2019)&nbsp;where Britney Muller goes over what you need to know to get started.</p>\n<p class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding: 6.25% 0px 28px; position: relative; text-align: center;\">\n</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/8gw0zeguwt?seo=false&videoFoam=true\" title=\"Page Speed Video\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" oallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n</iframe></figure>\n<p></p>\n<script rel=\"display: none;\" src=\"https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n<p></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5JfALsn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/page-speed-thumb-438625.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: rgb(153, 153, 153) 0px 0px 10px 0px; border-radius: 20px;\" data-image=\"gfwas7wccbqz\"></a></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"caption\">Click on the whiteboard image above to open a high resolution version in a new tab!<br>\n</p>\n<h2>Video Transcription</h2>\n<p>Hey, Moz fans. Welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Today we're going over all things page speed and really getting to the bottom of why it's so important for you to be thinking about and working on as you do your work.\n</p>\n<p>At the very fundamental level I'm going to briefly explain just how a web page is loaded. That way we can sort of wrap our heads around why all this matters.\n</p>\n<h2>How a webpage is loaded</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/screen-shot-2019-02-01-at-11-474484.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: rgb(153, 153, 153) 0px 0px 10px 0px; border-radius: 20px;\" data-image=\"jk00hniqd2kc\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>A user goes to a browser, puts in your website, and there is a DNS request. This points at your domain name provider, so maybe GoDaddy, and this points to your server where your files are located, and this is where it gets interesting. So the DOM starts to load all of your HTML, your CSS, and your JavaScript. But very rarely does this one pull all of the needed scripts or needed code to render or load a web page.\n</p>\n<p>Typically the DOM will need to request additional resources from your server to make everything happen, and this is where things start to really slow down your site. Having that sort of background knowledge I hope will help in us being able to triage some of these issues.\n</p>\n<h2>Issues that could be slowing down your site</h2>\n<p>What are some of the most common culprits?\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost is images. Large images are the biggest culprit of slow loading web pages. </li>\n<li>Hosting can cause issues. </li>\n<li>Plugins, apps, and widgets, basically any third-party script as well can slow down load time. </li>\n<li>Your theme and any large files beyond that can really slow things down as well. </li>\n<li>Redirects, the number of hops needed to get to a web page will slow things down. </li>\n<li>Then JavaScript, which we'll get into in a second. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>But all of these things can be a culprit. So we're going to go over some resources, some of the metrics and what they mean, and then what are some of the ways that you can improve your page speed today.\n</p>\n<h2>Page speed tools and resources</h2>\n<p>The primary resources I have listed here are Google tools and Google suggested insights. I think what's really interesting about these is we get to see what their concerns are as far as page speed goes and really start to see the shift towards the user. We should be thinking about that anyway. But first and foremost, how is this affecting people that come to your site, and then secondly, how can we also get the dual benefit of Google perceiving it as higher quality?\n</p>\n<p>We know that Google suggests a website to load anywhere between two to three seconds. The faster the better, obviously. But that's sort of where the range is. I also highly suggest you take a competitive view of that. Put your competitors into some of these tools and benchmark your speed goals against what's competitive in your industry. I think that's a cool way to kind of go into this.\n</p>\n<h3>Chrome User Experience Report</h3>\n<p>This is Chrome real user metrics. Unfortunately, it's only available for larger, popular websites, but you get some really good data out of it. It's housed on BigQuery*, so some basic SQL knowledge is needed.\n</p>\n<p><em>*Editor's note: We've edited this transcript for accuracy.&nbsp;In the video Britney said \"BigML,\" but intended to say BigQuery. It's hard filming an advanced-topic&nbsp;Whiteboard Friday in a single take! :-)</em></p>\n<h3>Lighthouse</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse, one of my favorites, is available right in Chrome Dev Tools. If you are on a web page and you click Inspect Element and you open up Chrome Dev Tools, to the far right tab where it says Audit, you can run a Lighthouse report right in your browser.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/screen-shot-2019-02-01-at-11-120228.jpg\" style=\"box-shadow: rgb(153, 153, 153) 0px 0px 10px 0px; border-radius: 20px;\" data-image=\"vomp5t5og26r\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>What I love about it is it gives you very specific examples and fixes that you can do. A fun fact to know is it will automatically be on the simulated fast 3G, and notice they're focused on mobile users on 3G. I like to switch that to applied fast 3G, because it has Lighthouse do an actual run of that load. It takes a little bit longer, but it seems to be a little bit more accurate. Good to know.\n</p>\n<h3>Page Speed Insights</h3>\n<p>Page Speed Insights is really interesting. They've now incorporated Chrome User Experience Report. But if you're not one of those large sites, it's not even going to measure your actual page speed. It's going to look at how your site is configured and provide feedback according to that and score it. Just something good to be aware of. It still provides good value.\n</p>\n<h3>Test your mobile website speed and performance</h3>\n<p>I don't know what the title of this is. If you do, please comment down below. But it's located on <a href=\"https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com</a>. This one is really cool because it tests the mobile speed of your site. If you scroll down, it directly ties it into ROI for your business or your website. We see Google leveraging real-world metrics, tying it back to what's the percentage of people you're losing because your site is this slow. It's a brilliant way to sort of get us all on board and fighting for some of these improvements.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pingdom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pingdom</a> and <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GTmetrix</a> are non-Google products or non-Google tools, but super helpful as well.\n</p>\n<h2>Site speed metrics</h2>\n<p>So what are some of the metrics?\n</p>\n<h3>What is first paint?</h3>\n<p>First paint is he first non-blank paint on a screen. It could be just the first pixel change. That initial change is considered first paint.\n</p>\n<h3>What is first contentful paint?</h3>\n<p>First contentful paint is when the first content appears. This might be part of the nav or the search bar or whatever it might be. --That's the first contentful paint.\n</p>\n<h3>What is first meaningful paint?</h3>\n<p>First meaningful paint is when primary content is visible. When you sort of get that reaction of, \"Oh, yeah, this is what I came to this page for,\" that's first meaningful paint.\n</p>\n<h3>What is time to interactive?</h3>\n<p>Time to interactive is when it's visually usable and engage-able. So we've all gone to a web page and it looks like it's done, but we can't quite use it yet. That's where this metric comes in. So when is it usable for the user? Again, notice how user-centric even these metrics are. Really, really neat.\n</p>\n<h3>DOM content loaded</h3>\n<p>The DOM content loaded, this is when the HTML is completely loaded and parsed. So some really good ones to keep an eye on and just to be aware of in general.\n</p>\n<h2>Ways to improve your page speed</h2>\n<h3>HTTP/2</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 can definitely speed things up. As to what extent, you have to sort of research that and test.\n</p>\n<h3>Preconnect, prefetch, preload</h3>\n<p>Preconnect, prefetch, and preload really interesting and important in speeding up a site. We see Google doing this on their SERPs. If you inspect an element, you can see Google prefetching some of the URLs so that it has it faster for you if you were to click on some of those results. You can similarly do this on your site. It helps to load and speed up that process.\n</p>\n<h3>Enable caching & use a content delivery network (CDN)</h3>\n<p>Caching is so, so important. Definitely do your research and make sure that's set up properly. Same with CDNs, so valuable in speeding up a site, but you want to make sure that your CDN is set up properly.\n</p>\n<h3>Compress images</h3>\n<p>The easiest and probably quickest way for you to speed up your site today is really just to compress those images. It's such an easy thing to do. There are all sorts of free tools available for you to compress them. <a href=\"https://imagecompressor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Optimizilla</a> is one. You can even use free tools on your computer, Save for Web, and compress properly.\n</p>\n<h3>Minify resources</h3>\n<p>You can also minify resources. So it's really good to be aware of what <a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/cdn-guide/glossary/minification.html\" target=\"_blank\">minification</a>, bundling, and compression do so you can have some of these more technical conversations with developers or with anyone else working on the site.\n</p>\n<p>So this is sort of a high-level overview of page speed. There's a ton more to cover, but I would love to hear your input and your questions and comments down below in the comment section.\n</p>\n<p>I really appreciate you checking out this edition of Whiteboard Friday, and I will see you all again soon.

This points at your domain name provider, so maybe GoDaddy, and this points to your server where your files are located, and this is where it gets interesting. So the DOM starts to load all of your HTML, your CSS, and your JavaScript. But very rarely does this one pull all of the needed scripts or needed code to render or load a web page.\n\nTypically the DOM will need to request additional resources from your server to make everything happen, and this is where things start to really slow down your site. Having that sort of background knowledge I hope will help in us being able to triage some of these issues.\n\nIssues that could be slowing down your site\nWhat are some of the most common culprits?\n\n\nFirst and foremost is images. Large images are the biggest culprit of slow loading web pages. \nHosting can cause issues. \nPlugins, apps, and widgets, basically any third-party script as well can slow down load time. \nYour theme and any large files beyond that can really slow things down as well. \nRedirects, the number of hops needed to get to a web page will slow things down. \nThen JavaScript, which we'll get into in a second. \n\nBut all of these things can be a culprit. So we're going to go over some resources, some of the metrics and what they mean, and then what are some of the ways that you can improve your page speed today.\n\nPage speed tools and resources\nThe primary resources I have listed here are Google tools and Google suggested insights. I think what's really interesting about these is we get to see what their concerns are as far as page speed goes and really start to see the shift towards the user. We should be thinking about that anyway. But first and foremost, how is this affecting people that come to your site, and then secondly, how can we also get the dual benefit of Google perceiving it as higher quality?\n\nWe know that Google suggests a website to load anywhere between two to three seconds. The faster the better, obviously. But that's sort of where the range is. I also highly suggest you take a competitive view of that. Put your competitors into some of these tools and benchmark your speed goals against what's competitive in your industry. I think that's a cool way to kind of go into this.\n\nChrome User Experience Report\nThis is Chrome real user metrics. Unfortunately, it's only available for larger, popular websites, but you get some really good data out of it. It's housed on BigQuery*, so some basic SQL knowledge is needed.\n\n*Editor's note: We've edited this transcript for accuracy.&nbsp;In the video Britney said \"BigML,\" but intended to say BigQuery. It's hard filming an advanced-topic&nbsp;Whiteboard Friday in a single take! :-)\nLighthouse\nLighthouse, one of my favorites, is available right in Chrome Dev Tools. If you are on a web page and you click Inspect Element and you open up Chrome Dev Tools, to the far right tab where it says Audit, you can run a Lighthouse report right in your browser.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I love about it is it gives you very specific examples and fixes that you can do. A fun fact to know is it will automatically be on the simulated fast 3G, and notice they're focused on mobile users on 3G. I like to switch that to applied fast 3G, because it has Lighthouse do an actual run of that load. It takes a little bit longer, but it seems to be a little bit more accurate. Good to know.\n\nPage Speed Insights\nPage Speed Insights is really interesting. They've now incorporated Chrome User Experience Report. But if you're not one of those large sites, it's not even going to measure your actual page speed. It's going to look at how your site is configured and provide feedback according to that and score it. Just something good to be aware of. It still provides good value.\n\nTest your mobile website speed and performance\nI don't know what the title of this is. If you do, please comment down below. But it's located on testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com. This one is really cool because it tests the mobile speed of your site. If you scroll down, it directly ties it into ROI for your business or your website. We see Google leveraging real-world metrics, tying it back to what's the percentage of people you're losing because your site is this slow. It's a brilliant way to sort of get us all on board and fighting for some of these improvements.\n\nPingdom and GTmetrix are non-Google products or non-Google tools, but super helpful as well.\n\nSite speed metrics\nSo what are some of the metrics?\n\nWhat is first paint?\nFirst paint is he first non-blank paint on a screen. It could be just the first pixel change. That initial change is considered first paint.\n\nWhat is first contentful paint?\nFirst contentful paint is when the first content appears. This might be part of the nav or the search bar or whatever it might be. --That's the first contentful paint.\n\nWhat is first meaningful paint?\nFirst meaningful paint is when primary content is visible. When you sort of get that reaction of, \"Oh, yeah, this is what I came to this page for,\" that's first meaningful paint.\n\nWhat is time to interactive?\nTime to interactive is when it's visually usable and engage-able. So we've all gone to a web page and it looks like it's done, but we can't quite use it yet. That's where this metric comes in. So when is it usable for the user? Again, notice how user-centric even these metrics are. Really, really neat.\n\nDOM content loaded\nThe DOM content loaded, this is when the HTML is completely loaded and parsed. So some really good ones to keep an eye on and just to be aware of in general.\n\nWays to improve your page speed\nHTTP/2\nHTTP/2 can definitely speed things up. As to what extent, you have to sort of research that and test.\n\nPreconnect, prefetch, preload\nPreconnect, prefetch, and preload really interesting and important in speeding up a site. We see Google doing this on their SERPs. If you inspect an element, you can see Google prefetching some of the URLs so that it has it faster for you if you were to click on some of those results. You can similarly do this on your site. It helps to load and speed up that process.\n\nEnable caching & use a content delivery network (CDN)\nCaching is so, so important. Definitely do your research and make sure that's set up properly. Same with CDNs, so valuable in speeding up a site, but you want to make sure that your CDN is set up properly.\n\nCompress images\nThe easiest and probably quickest way for you to speed up your site today is really just to compress those images. It's such an easy thing to do. There are all sorts of free tools available for you to compress them. Optimizilla is one. You can even use free tools on your computer, Save for Web, and compress properly.\n\nMinify resources\nYou can also minify resources. So it's really good to be aware of what minification, bundling, and compression do so you can have some of these more technical conversations with developers or with anyone else working on the site.\n\nSo this is sort of a high-level overview of page speed. There's a ton more to cover, but I would love to hear your input and your questions and comments down below in the comment section.\n\nI really appreciate you checking out this edition of Whiteboard Friday, and I will see you all again soon. Thanks so much. See you.\n\nVideo transcription by Speechpad.com\n\n\nScoop up more SEO insights at MozCon Virtual this July\nDon't miss exclusive data, tips, workflows, and advice from Britney and our other fantastic speakers at this year's MozCon Virtual!

      "pubDate": "2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z",
      "author": "Paddy_Moogan",
      "content": "<p>Posted by <a href=\\\"https://moz.com/community/users/143993\\\">Paddy_Moogan</a></p><p>Over the years, I’ve often referred to our link building work as “campaigns”, which isn't wrong, but isn’t completely right, either. I think that as an industry we need to alter our mindset to focus on what link building should be: an ongoing, integrated, business-as-usual activity. </p>\n<p>Link building processes that work for brands now and that will continue to work in the future need to sit closer to the rest of the business. This means tighter integration with other disciplines, or at the very least, acknowledgment that link building isn’t a siloed activity or dark art like it used to be. </p>\n<p>In this post, I’d like to propose how we should think about link building and share some ways to make it more sustainable, efficient, and effective. </p>\n<h2>The problem with campaigns</h2>\n<p>I want to start by being super clear on something, and I make no apologies for reiterating this throughout this post: Link building campaigns aren’t a bad thing. My core point is that they should be thought of as one piece of the puzzle — not something we should focus all of our time and attention on. </p>\n<p>“Campaign”, in the context of link building or digital PR, implies a few things:</p>\n<ul><li>It has a start and an end point</li><li>It is a one-off activity</li><li>It is about a specific “thing”, whether that be a topic, product, or piece of content</li></ul>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with these as such, but link building shouldn’t be thought about only in these ways. If link building is seen as a series of one-off activities, or about a specific thing and with a start and end point, it’s never going to be integrated into a business the way it should be. It will always sit around the edges of marketing activity and not benefit the bottom line as much as it could. </p>\n<p>Even if you are reading this thinking that you’re okay because you have lots of campaigns lined up — maybe one a week, one a month, or one a quarter — the core problems still exist, but at a more zoomed-out level. </p>\n<p>As digital marketers, we want link building to be:</p>\n<ul><li>Taken seriously as a tactic which helps support SEO within a business</li><li>Integrated with other areas to allow for efficiency and wider benefits</li><li>Fit into the overarching digital strategy of a business</li><li>Have measurable, consistent results</li></ul>\n<p>Let me demonstrate the final point with the graph below, which is the monthly performance of an Aira client on a 6-8 week campaign schedule:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image-1-37016.jpg\" data-image=\"s95xiejfpom1\"></figure>\n<p>On the face of it, this looks pretty good. We built over 200 links in 12 months, and were ahead of target in terms of individual campaign objectives. </p>\n<p>This graph is the reality of link building campaign execution. We were honest and up-front with clients about the results, and those peaks and dips are perfectly normal. </p>\n<p>But it could (and should) be a lot better. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a quick step back.</p>\n<h2>An uncomfortable truth</h2>\n<p>The uncomfortable truth for many link builders is that a business shouldn’t really need to worry about link building as an intentional, proactive activity. Instead, links should be a natural consequence of a fantastic product or service which is marketed and branded well. </p>\n<p>However, companies in this position are the exception rather than the rule, which means that as link builders, we still have a job!</p>\n<p>I’d argue that there are only a relatively small number of businesses that truly don’t need to worry about link building. Think of the likes of well-established and popular brands like Apple, McDonalds, Amazon and Coca-Cola. These companies truly are the exception, rather than the rule.</p>\n<p>Trying to be an exception and aiming to reach the nirvana of never actively worrying about link building should absolutely be your goal. Putting efforts into areas such as product development, customer service, content strategy, and brand building will all pay dividends when it comes to link building. But they all take time and you need to generate organic traffic sooner rather than later in order to grow the business.</p>\n<p>Link building, as part of your larger integrated and robust digital strategy can get you there quicker. I worry that businesses often leave money on the table by waiting for that nirvana to come. They may indeed get there, but could they have gotten there sooner?</p>\n<p>The question then becomes, how do they move quicker toward that ideal state, and what does link building look like in the interim? Running campaigns can help for sure, but you’re not really building upward as quickly as you could be.</p>\n<p>This is the crux of my worry and problem with running link building campaigns and allowing our strategies to lean on them too heavily:</p>\n<p>When the campaigns stop, so will the links. </p>\n<p>I know, I know — Aira launches campaigns all the time.</p>\n<p>Yes, we have launched many, many link building campaigns at Aira over the years and have been nominated for campaign-specific awards for some of them. I’ve even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aira.net/blog/using-data-improve-link-building-campaigns/\">written about them</a> many times. Campaign-led link building has a very valuable part to play in the world of link building, but we need to reframe our thinking and move away from campaigns as the primary way to generate links to a business. </p>\n<h2>Driving the right behaviors</h2>\n<p>It’s not just about results. It’s about driving the right behaviors within businesses, too. </p>\n<p>Putting link building in the corner of a one-off project or campaign-led activity is not going to encourage habitual link building. It will drive behaviors and thinking which you don’t really want, such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Link building is a line item which can be switched on and off</li><li>Internal processes have to bend or break in order to accommodate link building</li><li>There is little desire or motivation for wider team members to learn about what link builders do</li><li>Link building is an isolated activity with no integration</li><li>Link building results aren’t consistent (you get those huge peaks and dips in performance, which can bring into question the marketing spend you’re being given)</li></ul>\n<p>Working under these pressures is not going to make your life easy, nor are you going to do the best job you possibly can. </p>\n<p>I worry that as an industry, we’ve become too focused on launching campaign after campaign and have gotten too far away from effecting change within organizations through our work. </p>\n<p>As digital marketers, we are trying to influence behaviors. Ultimately, it’s about the behaviors of customers, but before that point it’s about influencing stakeholders — whether you’re an agency or in-house SEO, our first job is to get things done. In order to do that, link building needs to be thought of as a business-as-usual (BAU) activity. Campaigns have a place, but are part of a much, much bigger picture. Link building needs to get to the point where it’s not “special” to build links to a content piece, it’s just done. If we can get there, not only will we accelerate the businesses we work with toward link building nirvana, but we will add much, much more value to them in the meantime. </p>\n<h2>Link building as a BAU activity</h2>\n<p>It is my firm belief that in order to mature as an industry, and specifically as an activity, link building needs to be understood much more than it currently is. It still suffers from the issues that plagued SEO for many years in the early days when it truly was a dark art and we were figuring it out as we went along.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, we’ve come a long way, especially since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2012/04/another-step-to-reward-high-quality.html\">April 2012</a> (can you really believe it was over eight years ago?!) when link building began evolving into a content-led practice thanks in part to the Penguin update.</p>\n<p>But we still have further to go. </p>\n<p>We need to get out of the corner of “launching a campaign” and train our bosses and clients to ask questions like, “How can link building help here?” and “Is there a link building opportunity in this activity?”. </p>\n<h2>A case study</h2>\n<p>The best way I can explain this shift in thinking is to give you a real example of how we’ve done it at Aira. I can’t give you the exact client, but I can give you an overview of the journey we’ve been on with them, supporting an SEO team that is relentlessly committed to getting things done — the perfect partners for such an initiative. </p>\n<p>I should also point out that this has never been easy. We are on this journey with a number of our clients, and some of them are barely into it. The examples here show what happens when you get it right — but it does take time, and the reality is that it may never happen for some businesses. </p>\n<h3>Where it started</h3>\n<p>One campaign. That was it. One shot to get links and show the client what we could do.</p>\n<p>We failed.</p>\n<p>This was back in 2016. We were lucky in that the client trusted the process and understood why things had gone wrong on this occasion. So, they gave us another chance and this time did a great job. </p>\n<p>From there, the project grew and grew to the point where we were launching scaled campaigns like clockwork and getting links consistently. All was well. </p>\n<p>Then I was asked a question by someone on the client’s team:</p>\n<p>“What’s the evolution of our link building?”</p>\n<p>Whilst link building is never far from my mind, I didn’t have a mental model to answer this straight away with any conviction — particularly given what I knew about this client and their industry. I took some time to think about it and consolidate a bunch of observations and opinions I’d actually had for years, but never really made concrete.</p>\n<p>Side note: It’s often hard to take a step back from the day-to-day of what you’re doing and think about the bigger picture or the future. It’s even more difficult when you’re growing a business and generally doing good work. It can be hard to justify “rocking the boat” when things are going well, but I’ve learned that you need to find time for this reflection. For me at that point in time, it took a direct question from my client to force me into that mindset. </p>\n<h3>My answer</h3>\n<p>I confirmed that our existing model of link building for them was something that was likely to continue working and adding value, but that it should NOT be our sole focus in the coming years. </p>\n<p>Then, I explained what I’ve talked about in this post thus far.</p>\n<p>I told them that our work wasn’t good enough, despite them being one of our happiest, most long-standing clients. We were getting hundreds of links a month, but we could do better. </p>\n<p>Running campaign after campaign and getting links to each one would not be good enough in the future. Sure it works now, but what about in two years? Five?? Probably only partly. </p>\n<p>We knew we needed to bridge the gap between different content types:</p>\n<ul><li>Content for links (aka campaigns)</li><li>Content for traffic (informational and transactional pages)</li><li>Content for building expertise and trust</li></ul>\n<p>We’d only been focusing on the first one, pretty much in isolation. We’d come up with some relevant topic ideas, build them out and get links. Job done.</p>\n<p>This wouldn’t be good enough a few years down the road, because link building would be taking place in a small pocket of a very large organization with limited integration. </p>\n<p>It’s now been over a year since that conversation and guess what? Our campaigns are still working great, but we are evolving to do so much more. </p>\n<h3>What happened</h3>\n<p>If you haven’t taken a look at what else your business is doing and where link building can add value, this is the first step towards better integration, and thus better link building. By the time the conversation above happened, we’d already recognized the need to integrate with other teams within the client’s organization, so we had a head start. </p>\n<p>With the help of the client’s SEO team, we started to discover other activities within the organization which we could add value to or leverage for greater wins:</p>\n<ul><li>The traditional marketing team had been running campaigns for years on different industry topics. Some of these crossed over with the topics we’d created content for.</li><li>The internal PR team had lots of activity going on and had often seen our coverage pop up on their trackers. As it turned out, they were just as keen to meet us and understand more about our processes.</li><li>The brand team was starting to review all on-site assets to ensure conformity to brand guidelines. Working with them was going to be important moving forward for consistency’s sake.</li><li>With our help, the client were building out more informational content related to their products, with us helping brief their internal copywriters.</li></ul>\n<p>All of these opportunities sowed the seeds for a new focus on the evolution of link building, and pushed us to move quicker into a few things including:</p>\n<ul><li>Running joint projects with the internal PR team where we collaborate on ideas and outreach that don’t just focus on data visualization</li><li>Running ideation sessions around topics given to us by the SEO team, which are also focused on by their traditional marketing team</li><li>Building relationships with several subject matter experts within the organization who we are now working with and promoting online (more on this below)</li><li>Testing the informational product content for link building after noticing that a few pieces naturally attracted links</li><li>Working alongside the PR team to carry out brand-reclamation-style link building</li></ul>\n<h3>Where we are now</h3>\n<p>Just one year from that open and honest conversation, we have been able to show our value beyond launching campaign after campaign whilst still building links to the client’s content. This will hold value for years to come and mean that their reliance on campaigns will be reduced more and more over time. </p>\n<p>We’re making good progress toward taking our reliance off campaigns and making it part of our strategy — not all of it. Yes, campaigns still drive the majority of links, but our strategy now includes some key changes:</p>\n<ul><li>All campaigns (with the odd exception) are evergreen in nature, can always be outreached, and have the ability to attract links on their own.</li><li>We are launching long-form, report-style content pieces that demonstrate the authority and expertise the client has in their industry, and then building links to them. (They’re far slower in terms of getting links, but they are doing well.)</li><li>We are raising the profile of key spokespeople within the business by connecting them with writers and journalists who can contact them directly for quotes and comments in the future.</li><li>We are doing prospecting and outreach for informational content, aiming to give them a nudge in rankings which will lead to more links in the future (that we didn’t have to ask for).</li></ul>\n<p>Link building isn’t quite a BAU activity just yet for this client, but it’s not far off from becoming one. The practice is taken seriously, not just within the SEO team, but also within the wider marketing team. There is more awareness than there has ever been.</p>\n<h2>Content strategy framework</h2>\n<p>I want to share the framework which we’ve used to support and visualize the shift away from campaigns as our sole link building strategy. </p>\n<p>We’ve been aware for a while that we need to ensure any link building work we do is topically relevant. We’d found ourselves defaulting to content which was campaign-led and focused on links, as opposed to content that can serve other purposes.</p>\n<p>Link builders need to take a long, hard look at the topics we want our clients and businesses to be famous for, credible to talk about, and that resonate with their audience. Once you have these topics, you can start to plan your content execution. After that, you’ll start to see where link building fits in.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with the approach of “we need links, let’s come up with some relevant content ideas to help do that.” This can work, but isn’t as effective.</p>\n<p>To help clients shift their strategies, we put together the framework below. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image-2-80780.jpg\" data-image=\"7vkb4z53vvav\"></figure>\n<p>Let’s imagine we sell products that help customers sleep better. We may come up with the following themes and topics:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><span id=\"selection-marker-start\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\">﻿</span><span id=\"selection-marker-end\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\">﻿</span><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image-3-54204.jpg\" data-image=\"wi8cfrc1xi2f\"></figure>\n<p>Notice that “Campaigns” is only one format. We’re also acknowledging that topics and themes can not only lead to other forms of content (and links), but also that our KPIs may not always be just links.</p>\n<p>If we put together a long-form content guide on the science of sleep, it may not get on the front page of the New York Times, but it may get a slow, steady stream of links and organic search traffic. This traffic could include potential customers for a sleep product. </p>\n<p>Once you have a specific topic in mind, you can go deeper into that topic and start thinking about what content pieces you can create to truly demonstrate expertise and authority. This will differ by client and by topic, but it could look something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image-4-92051.png\" data-image=\"hvl27bq5pz5n\"></figure>\n<p>In this case, the blue circles denote a topic + format which may be link-worthy. While the orange ones denote a valuable execution that aren’t as link-worthy, we may still want to create this content for longer-term link and traffic generation. </p>\n<h2>To wrap up</h2>\n<p>Link building campaigns still have huge amounts of value. But if that’s all you’re doing for clients, you’re leaving opportunities behind.

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Paddy_MooganOver the years, I’ve often referred to our link building work as “campaigns”, which isn't wrong, but isn’t completely right, either. I think that as an industry we need to alter our mindset to focus on what link building should be: an ongoing, integrated, business-as-usual activity. \nLink building processes that work for brands now and that will continue to work in the future need to sit closer to the rest of the business. This means tighter integration with other disciplines, or at the very least, acknowledgment that link building isn’t a siloed activity or dark art like it used to be. \nIn this post, I’d like to propose how we should think about link building and share some ways to make it more sustainable, efficient, and effective. \nThe problem with campaigns\nI want to start by being super clear on something, and I make no apologies for reiterating this throughout this post: Link building campaigns aren’t a bad thing. My core point is that they should be thought of as one piece of the puzzle — not something we should focus all of our time and attention on. \n“Campaign”, in the context of link building or digital PR, implies a few things:\nIt has a start and an end pointIt is a one-off activityIt is about a specific “thing”, whether that be a topic, product, or piece of content\nThere is nothing wrong with these as such, but link building shouldn’t be thought about only in these ways. If link building is seen as a series of one-off activities, or about a specific thing and with a start and end point, it’s never going to be integrated into a business the way it should be. It will always sit around the edges of marketing activity and not benefit the bottom line as much as it could. \nEven if you are reading this thinking that you’re okay because you have lots of campaigns lined up — maybe one a week, one a month, or one a quarter — the core problems still exist, but at a more zoomed-out level. \nAs digital marketers, we want link building to be:\nTaken seriously as a tactic which helps support SEO within a businessIntegrated with other areas to allow for efficiency and wider benefitsFit into the overarching digital strategy of a businessHave measurable, consistent results\nLet me demonstrate the final point with the graph below, which is the monthly performance of an Aira client on a 6-8 week campaign schedule:\n\nOn the face of it, this looks pretty good. We built over 200 links in 12 months, and were ahead of target in terms of individual campaign objectives. \nThis graph is the reality of link building campaign execution. We were honest and up-front with clients about the results, and those peaks and dips are perfectly normal. \nBut it could (and should) be a lot better. \nLet’s take a quick step back.\nAn uncomfortable truth\nThe uncomfortable truth for many link builders is that a business shouldn’t really need to worry about link building as an intentional, proactive activity. Instead, links should be a natural consequence of a fantastic product or service which is marketed and branded well. \nHowever, companies in this position are the exception rather than the rule, which means that as link builders, we still have a job!\nI’d argue that there are only a relatively small number of businesses that truly don’t need to worry about link building. Think of the likes of well-established and popular brands like Apple, McDonalds, Amazon and Coca-Cola. These companies truly are the exception, rather than the rule.\nTrying to be an exception and aiming to reach the nirvana of never actively worrying about link building should absolutely be your goal. Putting efforts into areas such as product development, customer service, content strategy, and brand building will all pay dividends when it comes to link building. But they all take time and you need to generate organic traffic sooner rather than later in order to grow the business.\nLink building, as part of your larger integrated and robust digital strategy can get you there quicker. I worry that businesses often leave money on the table by waiting for that nirvana to come. They may indeed get there, but could they have gotten there sooner?\nThe question then becomes, how do they move quicker toward that ideal state, and what does link building look like in the interim? Running campaigns can help for sure, but you’re not really building upward as quickly as you could be.\nThis is the crux of my worry and problem with running link building campaigns and allowing our strategies to lean on them too heavily:\nWhen the campaigns stop, so will the links. \nI know, I know — Aira launches campaigns all the time.\nYes, we have launched many, many link building campaigns at Aira over the years and have been nominated for campaign-specific awards for some of them. I’ve even written about them many times. Campaign-led link building has a very valuable part to play in the world of link building, but we need to reframe our thinking and move away from campaigns as the primary way to generate links to a business. \nDriving the right behaviors\nIt’s not just about results. It’s about driving the right behaviors within businesses, too. \nPutting link building in the corner of a one-off project or campaign-led activity is not going to encourage habitual link building. It will drive behaviors and thinking which you don’t really want, such as:\nLink building is a line item which can be switched on and offInternal processes have to bend or break in order to accommodate link buildingThere is little desire or motivation for wider team members to learn about what link builders doLink building is an isolated activity with no integrationLink building results aren’t consistent (you get those huge peaks and dips in performance, which can bring into question the marketing spend you’re being given)\nWorking under these pressures is not going to make your life easy, nor are you going to do the best job you possibly can. \nI worry that as an industry, we’ve become too focused on launching campaign after campaign and have gotten too far away from effecting change within organizations through our work. \nAs digital marketers, we are trying to influence behaviors. Ultimately, it’s about the behaviors of customers, but before that point it’s about influencing stakeholders — whether you’re an agency or in-house SEO, our first job is to get things done. In order to do that, link building needs to be thought of as a business-as-usual (BAU) activity. Campaigns have a place, but are part of a much, much bigger picture. Link building needs to get to the point where it’s not “special” to build links to a content piece, it’s just done. If we can get there, not only will we accelerate the businesses we work with toward link building nirvana, but we will add much, much more value to them in the meantime. \nLink building as a BAU activity\nIt is my firm belief that in order to mature as an industry, and specifically as an activity, link building needs to be understood much more than it currently is. It still suffers from the issues that plagued SEO for many years in the early days when it truly was a dark art and we were figuring it out as we went along.\nDon’t get me wrong, we’ve come a long way, especially since April 2012 (can you really believe it was over eight years ago?!) when link building began evolving into a content-led practice thanks in part to the Penguin update.\nBut we still have further to go. \nWe need to get out of the corner of “launching a campaign” and train our bosses and clients to ask questions like, “How can link building help here?” and “Is there a link building opportunity in this activity?”. \nA case study\nThe best way I can explain this shift in thinking is to give you a real example of how we’ve done it at Aira. I can’t give you the exact client, but I can give you an overview of the journey we’ve been on with them, supporting an SEO team that is relentlessly committed to getting things done — the perfect partners for such an initiative. \nI should also point out that this has never been easy.

In this topic, I want to dive a little bit deeper into the data and share insights about how the source of your content can be just as important in determining how your content will perform. </p>\n<p>In this analysis, I looked at 1,474 client content campaigns across six different data source categories: </p>\n<ul><li>Client data</li><li>Social media </li><li>Participatory methods</li><li>Publicly available data</li><li>Survey</li><li>Germ swab</li></ul>\n<p>It’s important to note that there are countless other data sources that we use for content campaigns every day at Fractl that are not mentioned in this article. In this analysis, each category has at least 20 campaigns, while some categories have several hundred campaigns. </p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that averages were collected by excluding upper outliers. For campaigns that went “viral” and performed well above the norm, we excluded them in the calculation so as not to skew the averages higher. </p>\n<p>In addition to sharing link and press averages, I will also be walking through how to produce pressworthy, sharable content from each data source and providing examples.</p>\n<h2>Managing expectations across content types</h2>\n<p>Across the entire sample of 1,474 campaigns, a project on average received 24 dofollow links and 89 press mentions in total. </p>\n<p>A press mention is defined as any time the content campaign was mentioned on a publisher’s website.</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image4-59003.jpg\" data-image=\"qs40ybivugah\"></figure>\n<p>There were some individual data source category averages that were on par with the sample average, while other categories deviated greatly from the sample average. </p>\n<h2>Publicly available data</h2>\n<p>For almost any niche out there, you can bet there is a publicly available data set available for use. Some examples include data from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html\">CDC</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/data.html\">U.S. Census</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/\">colleges and universities</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/en/\">WHO</a>, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data\">TSA</a>. The opportunities really are endless when it comes to using publicly available data as a methodology for your content. </p>\n<p>While free data sets can be a treasure trove of information for your content, keep in mind that they’re not always the simplest to work with. They do require a lot of analysis to make sense of the massive amount of information in them, and to make the insights digestible for your audience.</p>\n<p>Take for example a campaign we produced for a client called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://porch.com/resource/neighborhood-names\">Neighborhood Names</a>. The data was free from the US Census, but in order to make any sense of it, our researchers had to use QGIS, Python, text-mining, and phrasemachine (a text analysis API)  just to narrow it down to what we were looking for. </p>\n<p>And what were we looking for? Looking at neighborhood names across America seems boring at first, until you realize that certain words correspond to wealth. </p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image1-60043.jpg\" data-image=\"d0ac666tfvne\"></figure>\n<p>I was the outreach specialist for this project, and by using the wealth angle, I was able to secure two notable placements on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/31/study-neighborhoods-with-these-words-in-the-name-are-wealthiest-in-us.html\">CNBC</a> as well as a press mention on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/whats-in-a-neighborhood-name-more-than-you-might-think/ar-BBML8Jg?srcref=rss\">MSN</a>. The project quickly made its way around the internet after that, earning 76 dofollow links and 202 total press mentions by the end of our reporting period. </p>\n<h2>Survey</h2>\n<p>Unlike scouring the internet for free data, using a survey as a methodology can be more costly. That being said, there is one major advantage to using a survey to shape your content: you can find out anything you want. </p>\n<p>While publicly available data will tell a story, it’s not always the story you want to tell, and that’s where surveys come in. </p>\n<p>Of course, when it comes to surveys, anyone can create one without paying attention to research method best practices. That's one of the problems we need to address. With “fake news” in the forefront of everyone’s minds in 2020, building trust with journalists and editors is of the utmost importance.</p>\n<p>As content creators, we have a responsibility to ensure that content is not only attention-grabbing and entertaining, but also accurate and informative. </p>\n<p>Survey campaigns, in particular, require you to analyze responses through a rigorous methodological lens. When collecting data for surveys, be sure to pay close attention to ethical upholdance, data validity, and fair visual representations.</p>\n<h2>Germ swab</h2>\n<p>From my own personal experience, germ swab content campaigns are the most fun, and often, the most disturbing. Fractl did some research a while back about the emotions that make content go viral, and oftentimes, germ swab campaigns hit all of the right emotions in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/10/research-the-emotions-that-make-marketing-campaigns-go-viral\">viral equation</a>. </p>\n<p>Negative emotions like disgust are often evoked when reviewing the results of germ swab campaigns. Our study found that when negative emotions are paired with emotions like anticipation or surprise, they can still achieve viral success (internet viral, not germ viral). What is more surprising than finding out the airplane tray table is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.travelmath.com/feature/airline-hygiene-exposed/\">dirtier than a toilet seat</a>? </p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image2-142360.jpg\" data-image=\"ct3i2aco3eul\"></figure>\n<p>Publishers around the world seemed to think the content was surprising, too. This campaign performed above the norm for a typical content campaign earning 38 dofollows and 195 total press mentions — and this was before the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>\n<h2>Participatory methods</h2>\n<p>Participatory methods are campaigns that require active participation for the methodology. These are unique ideas — no two are alike. Some examples of campaigns that fall under the participatory methods category are when we had team members do <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dred.com/uk/your-ass-on-squats.html\">a 30-day squat challenge</a>, asked respondents to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.signs.com/branded-in-memory/\">draw brand logos from memory</a>, or when we literally drove from D.C. to NYC with a dash cam to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.busbud.com/blog/breaking-the-laws-of-the-road/\">record traffic violations</a>. </p>\n<p>These campaigns have a certain level of risk associated with them. They require a lot of upfront effort and planning without the promise of any return — and that’s scary for clients and for our team who put in tremendous effort to pull them off. </p>\n<p>As you can see from the chart above, however, these ideas collectively performed right on par with  other campaign types, and even better than survey methodologies for both the number of dofollow links and press mentions. In order to reap big benefits, it seems you need to be willing to take a big risk. </p>\n<h2>Social media </h2>\n<p>Social media as a data source is almost a no-brainer, right up there with survey methodologies and publicly available data sets. Unlike participatory methods campaigns, you don’t have to leave your computer in order to produce a campaign based on social media data. </p>\n<p>Through our seven years of content creation, Fractl has produced campaigns based on data scrapes from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and more. From this experience, we know firsthand what kinds of social campaigns work and which ones fall flat. </p>\n<p>The best thing about using social media as a source for content is that it can be applied to all verticals. </p>\n<p>The biggest lesson we’ve learned from producing content based on social media data is that the methodology is typically subjective, so you need to keep the project lighthearted in nature in order to earn major coverage. </p>\n<p>For example, we produced a campaign for a client in which we looked at Instagram posts with the hashtag #sexy and a geolocation. From this, we were able to glean the “sexiest” countries in the world as well as U.S. states. </p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/image3-115044.jpg\" data-image=\"d2dh4e6fvalh\"></figure>\n<p>While it would be impossible to learn what the actual sexiest places in the world were, (what does that even mean?) we were able to produce a fun campaign that used geo-bait to appeal to lighthearted publishers, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/sexiest-places-on-eart\">Glamour</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eonline.com/news/750464/these-are-the-states-that-think-they-re-the-sexiest-on-instagram\">E! Online</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19939845/sexiest-places-on-earth/\">Women's Health</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/envision/sexiest-places-in-the-world-according-to-instagram/1424197\">Elite Daily</a>. </p>\n<p>Make sure that no matter the topic, whatever you produce contributes to an ongoing conversation. Statistics that don’t point to anything meaningful won’t be relevant for writers actually trying to add to the conversation. </p>\n<h2>Client data</h2>\n<p>Client data is often the most underappreciated data source for content marketers. You may be sitting on a wealth of actionable industry insights and not even know it. </p>\n<p>You might think of internal data as only being useful for improving your internal processes at work, but it can also be valuable outside of your organization. </p>\n<p>Unlike publicly available data, internal data is never-before-seen and 100% unique. Journalists eat this up because it means that you’re providing completely exclusive resources.</p>\n<p>Think of this article, for example. This article is filled with data and insights that Fractl has gleaned after producing thousands of content marketing campaigns. </p>\n<p>An added bonus of using internal data to craft your content is that, according to our analysis, it performs on par with surveys. Unlike surveys, though, it’s completely free. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>No matter what methodology you’re using or vertical you’re creating content for, it’s important to realize that as content creators, we have an ethical and moral responsibility to create with an audience in mind.</p>\n<p>With “fake news” on the forefront of everyone’s minds, building and maintaining trust with writers and editors is of the utmost importance.</p>\n<p>All of the content you produce and promote must be assessed through a rigorous methodological lens to ensure that content is accurate and informative as well as eye-grabbing and entertaining. </p>\n<p>Regardless of your methodology, if you don’t take the proper steps to make sure your data sources are accurate, you are contributing to the fake news epidemic. </p>\n<p></p><br /><p><a href=\"https://moz.com/moztop10\">Sign up for The Moz Top 10</a>, a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

Welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Today we are going to be looking at the easiest ways for you to get backlinks to your website. None of these involve content creation whatsoever. </p>\n<p>Really excited to dive into this. It will be part of a larger \"Link Building in 2020 Series and Beyond.\" So really excited to dive into some of the easiest things that you can do today to enhance your backlink profile. Let's take a look. </p>\n<h2>No-brainer link building</h2>\n<h3>☑ Unlinked brand, product, name, etc. mentions</h3>\n<p>This is simply just going to Google, doing a search for these things within quotes, and looking at the first several pages of results to ensure that all of those results are linking back to your site. </p>\n<p>They likely are not, so those will be your opportunities to send a message or an email asking for the webmaster or the writer to provide a link back to your site with your mention. It's one of the easiest things to do. So is <strong>unlinked images.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3>☑ Unlinked images</h3>\n<p><strong></strong>This is a gold mine if you're working with a website that has a lot of proprietary images or really great graphic design, maybe you have infographics or some things that are special to the brand or the domain. <strong>Use Google reverse image search and put in the images that you think might have been taken or used on other websites. </strong></p>\n<p>You will immediately see what those websites are and whether or not they link back to your site. So again, very similar to this first one. You're basically just asking for them to credit the website and link back accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑&nbsp;Redirect your 404 pages with backlinks</h3>\n<p>This is completely within your control. No outreach required. In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/link-explorer\">Moz Link Explorer</a> provides this really, really easily within <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/products/pro\">Moz Pro</a>. You basically take a look at all of your pages that have backlinks, and you can filter by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/http-status-codes\">status code</a>. </p>\n<p>You just change that to 400s, 404s, and you can see all of the pages to your website that currently have backlinks but the page is no longer there. All you want to do with that is just simply 301 redirect that old broken page to a new relevant page, and you're kind of saving that authority that is being sent to your site. </p>\n<p>So, so easy. A lot of people forget about that one. It's great.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑&nbsp;Keep an eye on recently lost links</h3>\n<p>The keyword here is \"recently.\" If you can engage with another website that has recently either by accident or changed things around on purpose on the page, you are more likely to reclaim your lost link. </p>\n<p><strong>It's also just important to really understand why.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong></strong>Is that website going through a redesign?&nbsp;</li><li>Have they gotten rid of pages?&nbsp;</li><li>Did a competitor come in and provide a better resource than what you currently had?&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<p>There are all sorts of reasons why you really want to identify what's going on. </p>\n<h3>☑ Move backlink targets</h3>\n<p>This is a new tactic that was recently brought to my attention by the brilliant Sarah Hollenbeck at Siege Media. They have a brilliant team. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.siegemedia.com/marketing/advanced-link-reclamation\">I highly recommend you checking out this article</a> that's basically all about moving backlink targets, which has never really occurred to me, where you basically have backlinks to older resources or older content or products that you want restructured to newer or more important pages on your website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sarah goes into great detail about this and can help explain just how you can do this successfully and what that means for your site. So really, really neat. I highly suggest that.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑ Sites that list competitors, but not you</h3>\n<p>Check out sites that list competitors but not you. These might be resource pages or roundups of information of sorts. </p>\n<p>You can play around with this in Google as well by <strong>providing competitors within quotes and then minus your company or the website you're working on.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/screen-shot-2020-06-25-at-4-62333.png\" data-image=\"2se233ydznut\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\"></figure>\n<p>It really starts to give you an idea of what websites might be great opportunities for a backlink, because you fit within that vein. It makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑ &nbsp;Sites that provide topic/industry + geo information</h3>\n<p>Similarly sites that provide topic or industry plus geo information, so again finding those resource pages, those roundups. Oftentimes you will see these on lots of .edu sites or even .gov. So you can do some different searches around, if you were Columbia, outdoor clothing in Minnesota. </p>\n<p>Play around with this a bit. This could be in the Midwest, in the United States. You can change these words around and really start to identify some higher-quality link prospects.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑ Build relationships</h3>\n<p>Lastly, build relationships. I cannot speak more highly about this. </p>\n<p>Just for your own career longevity and what you do in SEO and marketing in general, it is so important to develop genuine, real relationships with individuals that work in the industry, whether that be at other websites or just in the same vein of things. </p>\n<p>Not only can you bounce ideas off of these people and really get help with different things, but you get to help support the incredible things that they're working on. It's just an all-around, feel-good, help each other out situation. So if you're not already reaching out and building relationships, I highly suggest you do that. </p>\n<p>It's a lot of fun, and I can't stress enough there are so, so many good people within our industry it's incredible.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>☑ BONUS: Let people choose anchor text!</h3>\n<p>Lastly, we really want to take a modern look at link building practices in 2020 and beyond, and a big part of that goes around things like<strong> let people choose the anchor text for your backlink. </strong></p>\n<p>Five or 10 years ago it was standard to request very specific anchor text for the keyword you wanted to rank for. It's not really the case anymore. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/what-is-bert\">Especially with the addition of BERT</a>, Google has gotten so much more sophisticated in understanding text and language and websites that it's really unnecessary and might even cause problems to ask for those specific anchor link texts. </p>\n<p>Definitely take a look at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/10-link-building-lies-you-must-ignore\">this article we'll link to down below by David Farkas</a> here, who wrote about link building lies. It's a really great article. We'll continue to build upon this series to provide you with some fresher information around link building today. I really look forward to hearing your comments and suggestions down below. </p>\n<p>Feel free to let us know what you liked about this, what you didn't like.

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by BritneyMullerLink building is never-ending in SEO, but a little creativity and smart tactics can help you ferret out great link opportunities from their hiding spots. In this episode of Whiteboard Friday, Britney Muller kicks off a series on modern link building (including the sage advice: let people choose their own anchor text!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the whiteboard image above to open a high resolution version in a new tab!\n\nVideo Transcription\nHey, Moz fans. Welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Today we are going to be looking at the easiest ways for you to get backlinks to your website. None of these involve content creation whatsoever. \nReally excited to dive into this. It will be part of a larger \"Link Building in 2020 Series and Beyond.\" So really excited to dive into some of the easiest things that you can do today to enhance your backlink profile. Let's take a look. \nNo-brainer link building\n☑ Unlinked brand, product, name, etc. mentions\nThis is simply just going to Google, doing a search for these things within quotes, and looking at the first several pages of results to ensure that all of those results are linking back to your site. \nThey likely are not, so those will be your opportunities to send a message or an email asking for the webmaster or the writer to provide a link back to your site with your mention. It's one of the easiest things to do. So is unlinked images.&nbsp;\n☑ Unlinked images\nThis is a gold mine if you're working with a website that has a lot of proprietary images or really great graphic design, maybe you have infographics or some things that are special to the brand or the domain. Use Google reverse image search and put in the images that you think might have been taken or used on other websites. \nYou will immediately see what those websites are and whether or not they link back to your site. So again, very similar to this first one. You're basically just asking for them to credit the website and link back accordingly.&nbsp;\n☑&nbsp;Redirect your 404 pages with backlinks\nThis is completely within your control. No outreach required. In fact, Moz Link Explorer provides this really, really easily within Moz Pro. You basically take a look at all of your pages that have backlinks, and you can filter by status code. \nYou just change that to 400s, 404s, and you can see all of the pages to your website that currently have backlinks but the page is no longer there. All you want to do with that is just simply 301 redirect that old broken page to a new relevant page, and you're kind of saving that authority that is being sent to your site. \nSo, so easy. A lot of people forget about that one. It's great.&nbsp;\n☑&nbsp;Keep an eye on recently lost links\nThe keyword here is \"recently.\" If you can engage with another website that has recently either by accident or changed things around on purpose on the page, you are more likely to reclaim your lost link. \nIt's also just important to really understand why.&nbsp;\nIs that website going through a redesign?&nbsp;Have they gotten rid of pages?&nbsp;Did a competitor come in and provide a better resource than what you currently had?&nbsp;\nThere are all sorts of reasons why you really want to identify what's going on. \n☑ Move backlink targets\nThis is a new tactic that was recently brought to my attention by the brilliant Sarah Hollenbeck at Siege Media. They have a brilliant team. I highly recommend you checking out this article that's basically all about moving backlink targets, which has never really occurred to me, where you basically have backlinks to older resources or older content or products that you want restructured to newer or more important pages on your website.&nbsp;\nSarah goes into great detail about this and can help explain just how you can do this successfully and what that means for your site. So really, really neat. I highly suggest that.&nbsp;\n☑ Sites that list competitors, but not you\nCheck out sites that list competitors but not you. These might be resource pages or roundups of information of sorts. \nYou can play around with this in Google as well by providing competitors within quotes and then minus your company or the website you're working on.&nbsp;\n\nIt really starts to give you an idea of what websites might be great opportunities for a backlink, because you fit within that vein. It makes sense.&nbsp;\n☑ &nbsp;Sites that provide topic/industry + geo information\nSimilarly sites that provide topic or industry plus geo information, so again finding those resource pages, those roundups. Oftentimes you will see these on lots of .edu sites or even .gov. So you can do some different searches around, if you were Columbia, outdoor clothing in Minnesota. \nPlay around with this a bit. This could be in the Midwest, in the United States. You can change these words around and really start to identify some higher-quality link prospects.&nbsp;\n☑ Build relationships\nLastly, build relationships. I cannot speak more highly about this. \nJust for your own career longevity and what you do in SEO and marketing in general, it is so important to develop genuine, real relationships with individuals that work in the industry, whether that be at other websites or just in the same vein of things. \nNot only can you bounce ideas off of these people and really get help with different things, but you get to help support the incredible things that they're working on. It's just an all-around, feel-good, help each other out situation. So if you're not already reaching out and building relationships, I highly suggest you do that. \nIt's a lot of fun, and I can't stress enough there are so, so many good people within our industry it's incredible.&nbsp;\n☑ BONUS: Let people choose anchor text!\nLastly, we really want to take a modern look at link building practices in 2020 and beyond, and a big part of that goes around things like let people choose the anchor text for your backlink. \nFive or 10 years ago it was standard to request very specific anchor text for the keyword you wanted to rank for. It's not really the case anymore. Especially with the addition of BERT, Google has gotten so much more sophisticated in understanding text and language and websites that it's really unnecessary and might even cause problems to ask for those specific anchor link texts. \nDefinitely take a look at this article we'll link to down below by David Farkas here, who wrote about link building lies. It's a really great article. We'll continue to build upon this series to provide you with some fresher information around link building today. I really look forward to hearing your comments and suggestions down below. \nFeel free to let us know what you liked about this, what you didn't like. If you have any great ideas, please let us know down in the comments, and I look forward to seeing you all next time. Thanks so much. See you.\nVideo transcription by Speechpad.com\n\n\n\nScoop up more SEO insights at MozCon Virtual this July\nDon't miss exclusive data, tips, workflows, and advice from Britney and our other fantastic speakers at this year's MozCon Virtual!

We promise we won't judge if you're watching in your jammies.)</em></p>\n<p>Read on to see what your favorite industry leaders are speaking on this year!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Tuesday, July 14th</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>8:30am – Networking</h3>\n<p>Open time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.</p>\n<h3>9:00am – <em>Keynote</em> – Welcome to MozCon Virtual 2020 + State of the Industry</h3>\n<h4>Sarah Bird, CEO of Moz</h4>\n<p>Sarah has a storied history of kicking MozCon off with a bright, sparkly bang. The fearless leader of Moz will be welcoming each and every one of us to this year's virtual event, laying out all the pertinent details of the conference, and setting the tone for two jam-packed days of learning with a look at the State of the Industry.</p>\n<h3>9:25am –&nbsp;<em>Keynote</em> –&nbsp;Thought Leadership and SEO: The 3 Key Elements and Search Ranking Strategies</h3>\n<h4>Andy Crestodina, Co-founder and CMO, <a href=\"https://www.orbitmedia.com/\">Orbit Media</a></h4>\n<p>Everyone wants to do it, but no one really knows what it is. So what is thought leadership? What isn’t it? And how does it affect search rankings? <br> <br> This presentation is a data-rich perspective on the oh-so-popular topic of thought leadership, filled with practical takeaways for becoming an authority. And it’s all about the relationship between thought leadership and SEO. We’ll see how the research answers the questions and informs the tactics: Can brands be thought leaders? Can it be outsourced? Do you need to publish research? Or strong opinion? And how does it attract links and authority, rankings, and qualified visitors? Learn how a personal brand combines with content to drive big wins in SEO.</p>\n<h3>10:20am – <em>Stream 1&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;Great Expectations: The Truth About Digital PR Campaigns<br></h3>\n<h4>Shannon McGuirk, Head of PR & Content, <a href=\"https://www.aira.net/\">Aira</a></h4>\n<p>In her talk, Shannon will challenge the desire for virality over consistency when it comes to digital PR and link building campaigns, while exploring the impact on the industry, team morale, and client expectations. By honestly sharing her own shortcomings, she'll push you to learn from your own campaign failures using tried and tested frameworks that’ll mean you can face any creative campaign or outreach struggle head-on.</p>\n<h3>10:20am – <em>Stream 2&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;Whatever You Do, Put Billboards in Seattle – Getting Brand Awareness Data from Google</h3>\n<h4>Robin Lord,&nbsp;Consultant,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.distilled.net/\">Distilled</a></h4>\n<p>How can you harness the vast power of Google data to gain special insight into city- and product-level brand awareness? Robin will lead us on a journey through his Google Trends methodology to use Adwords search volume data for better brand intelligence.</p>\n<h3>11:15am –<em> Stream 1&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;How to Build a Global Brand Without a Global Budget</h3>\n<h4>Phil Nottingham,&nbsp;Brand and Video Marketing Strategist, Phil Nottingham Ltd.</h4>\n<p>As funnel-based marketing becomes less effective and harder to measure, \"building a brand\" is frequently touted as the panacea for all marketer's woes. But it's unclear how this can be achieved scalably and with a limited budget. Large enterprises resort to huge creative advertising campaigns that get their names out there by force of spend alone — but this isn't realistic for the smaller companies and the number of impressions is not the number of people impressed. In this session, Phil explains how modern brands are built through advocacy more than awareness alone, offering a deliverable method of brand marketing to radically shake up your content strategy.</p>\n<h3>11:15am –<em> Stream 2&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;The Science of Seeking Your Customer</h3>\n<h4>Alexis Sanders,&nbsp;Senior SEO Account Manager, <a href=\"https://www.merkleinc.com/\">Merkle</a></h4>\n<p>Users are at the core of everything we do in modern SEO. However, finding and understanding audiences can be daunting. Alexis will cover how to find your audience, share tools that are available for all price points, and show ways in which she’s found audience research to be useful as an SEO.</p>\n<h3>12:10pm – Birds of a Feather discussion groups</h3>\n<p>Connect and chat with like-minded marketers on a wide range of digital marketing&nbsp;topics!</p>\n<h3>12:55pm –&nbsp;<em>Keynote</em> –&nbsp;Moving Targets: Keywords in Crisis</h3>\n<h4>Dr.&nbsp;Peter J. Meyers,&nbsp;Marketing Scientist, Moz</h4>\n<p>Too often, we take a once-and-done approach to keyword research, but Google changes at the pace of information, and that pace speeds up even more during a crisis. How do we do keyword research in fast-paced industries and during world-changing moments? Dr. Pete provides concrete tactics for adaptive keyword research and spotting trends as they happen.</p>\n<h3>1:45pm –<em> Stream 1&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;A Novel Approach to Scraping SEO Data</h3>\n<h4>Rob Ousbey, VP Product, Moz</h4>\n<p>Throughout a decade in SEO consulting, Rob needed to extract data from websites on many an occasion. Often this was at scale from sites that didn't have an API or export feature, or on sites that required some kind of authentication. While this was primarily a way to collect & combine data from different SEO tools, the use-cases were endless.</p>\n<p>He found a technique that helped immensely, particularly when traditional tools couldn't do the job — but hadn't seen anyone using the same approach. In this very tactical session, Rob will walk through the steps he's used to extract data from all sorts of sites, from small fry to the giants, and give you the tools and knowledge to do the same.</p>\n<h3>1:45pm –<em> Stream 2&nbsp;</em>– Let It Go: How to Embrace Automation and Get Way More Done</h3>\n<h4>Francine Rodriguez,&nbsp;Manager of Customer Success,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/\">WordStream</a></h4>\n<p>Let the robot uprising begin! We've all heard horror stories about the dangers of automating your tasks, but now is not the time to deny yourself extra help. Robots never sleep. They don't get tired or overwhelmed by their to-do lists, and they're ready to work round-the-clock to accomplish whatever task we set before them. In this talk, you'll explore all the areas were automation is kicking butt in PPC — and how you can harness the power of robots to make more time for other efforts.</p>\n<h3>2:35pm – <em>Keynote</em> –&nbsp;Designing a Content Engine: Going from Ideation to Creation to Distribution</h3>\n<h4>Ross Simmonds,&nbsp;CEO, <a href=\"https://foundationinc.co/\">Foundation</a></h4>\n<p>What does it take to develop a content engine that drives results? In this presentation, Ross will share data around the power of having a content engine, tools & strategies for content ideation, tools and tactics for content creation, and frameworks that brands can use to ensure that their content is distributed effectively after hitting publish. This presentation will help you not only uncover content-market fit, but also capitalize on it.</p>\n<h3>3:30pm – Networking</h3>\n<p>Open time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.</p>\n<h3>4:30pm — Day One is in the books!</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>Wednesday, July 15th</h2>\n<hr>\n<h3>8:30am – Networking</h3>\n<p>Open time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.</p>\n<h3>9:00am – Welcome to Day Two!</h3>\n<h4>Cyrus Shepard, emcee</h4>\n<h3>9:10am – <em>Keynote</em> – Accessible Machine Learning Workflows for SEOs</h3>\n<h4>Britney Muller,&nbsp;Senior SEO Scientist, Moz<br></h4>\n<p>\"Machine learning\" and \"automation\" aren't words SEOs need to fear.

By not properly analyzing or enhancing our organic CTR, we're greatly limiting our potential. Izzi will help you create the perfect SERP engagement strategy by covering practical ways to uplift your significant CTR, such as remedying your critical keyword rankings that could soon be lost, leveraging brand-empowering entity features (and assessing the risks of doing so), more intelligent testing of rich & featured snippet optimizations, and a whole lot more. CTR-you-ready?? You better be!</p>\n<h3>9:55am –<em> Stream 2&nbsp;</em>–&nbsp;<em></em>How to Go Beyond Marketing for Clients: The Value of a Thriving Brand Ecosystem</h3>\n<h4>Flavilla Fongang,&nbsp;Brand Strategist, <a href=\"https://www.3coloursrule.co.uk/london-branding-agency/\">3 Colours Rule</a></h4>\n<p>Too many marketers serve their clients the bare minimum of what's expected from an agency. To stand out among the crowd, cultivate real loyalty, and maximize the lifetime value of your clients, you have to go beyond mere marketing — developing a thriving brand ecosystem that aligns with the brand's ultimate goals. Flavilla Fongang shares her tried-and-true framework for optimizing the customer journey, improving acquisition and retention, and going beyond what's expected to serve your clients well.</p>\n<h3>10:50am&nbsp;– <em>Stream 1&nbsp;</em>– How to Promote Your Content Like a Boss<br></h3>\n<h4>Brian Dean,&nbsp;Founder, <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/\">Backlinko</a></h4>\n<p>Creating content is easy. But getting people to see your content? That's a different story. Brian Dean shares over a dozen practical strategies that you can use to spread the word about your latest blog post, podcast episode, or YouTube video.</p>\n<h3>10:50am – <em>Stream 2&nbsp;</em>– Google My Business: Battling Bad Info & Safeguarding Your Search Strategy</h3>\n<h4>Joy Hawkins,&nbsp;Owner, <a href=\"https://www.sterlingsky.ca/\">Sterling Sky Inc.</a></h4>\n<p>What's the harm in a little misinformation here and there? In the realm of local SEO, Joy Hawkins is here to outline exactly that. When it comes to local search and Google My Business, bad info can be make or break for your campaigns. Follow real data from a recent case study that illustrates why strategic decisions should be based on accurate information — and what can happen when that info is bad, wrong, or just plain incomplete.</p>\n<h3>11:45am – Birds of a Feather discussion groups</h3>\n<p>Connect and chat with like-minded marketers on a wide range of digital marketing topics!</p>\n<h3>12:10pm –&nbsp;<em>Keynote&nbsp;</em>– Runtime: The 3-Ring Circus of Technical SEO</h3>\n<h4>Michael King<em>,</em>&nbsp;Managing Director, <a href=\"https://ipullrank.com/\">iPullRank</a></h4>\n<p>Mike redefined technical SEO and its importance in our industry back in 2016. In 2018, he taught us everything we didn't know about SEO.

If this will be your first time attending, we'd love to hear what talk you're most excited for in the comments.&nbsp;(All talk times are in Pacific, so keep that in mind when planning your day! We promise we won't judge if you're watching in your jammies.)\nRead on to see what your favorite industry leaders are speaking on this year!\n\nTuesday, July 14th\n\n8:30am – Networking\nOpen time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.\n9:00am – Keynote – Welcome to MozCon Virtual 2020 + State of the Industry\nSarah Bird, CEO of Moz\nSarah has a storied history of kicking MozCon off with a bright, sparkly bang. The fearless leader of Moz will be welcoming each and every one of us to this year's virtual event, laying out all the pertinent details of the conference, and setting the tone for two jam-packed days of learning with a look at the State of the Industry.\n9:25am –&nbsp;Keynote –&nbsp;Thought Leadership and SEO: The 3 Key Elements and Search Ranking Strategies\nAndy Crestodina, Co-founder and CMO, Orbit Media\nEveryone wants to do it, but no one really knows what it is. So what is thought leadership? What isn’t it? And how does it affect search rankings?   This presentation is a data-rich perspective on the oh-so-popular topic of thought leadership, filled with practical takeaways for becoming an authority. And it’s all about the relationship between thought leadership and SEO. We’ll see how the research answers the questions and informs the tactics: Can brands be thought leaders? Can it be outsourced? Do you need to publish research? Or strong opinion? And how does it attract links and authority, rankings, and qualified visitors? Learn how a personal brand combines with content to drive big wins in SEO.\n10:20am – Stream 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;Great Expectations: The Truth About Digital PR Campaigns\nShannon McGuirk, Head of PR & Content, Aira\nIn her talk, Shannon will challenge the desire for virality over consistency when it comes to digital PR and link building campaigns, while exploring the impact on the industry, team morale, and client expectations. By honestly sharing her own shortcomings, she'll push you to learn from your own campaign failures using tried and tested frameworks that’ll mean you can face any creative campaign or outreach struggle head-on.\n10:20am – Stream 2&nbsp;–&nbsp;Whatever You Do, Put Billboards in Seattle – Getting Brand Awareness Data from Google\nRobin Lord,&nbsp;Consultant,&nbsp;Distilled\nHow can you harness the vast power of Google data to gain special insight into city- and product-level brand awareness? Robin will lead us on a journey through his Google Trends methodology to use Adwords search volume data for better brand intelligence.\n11:15am – Stream 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;How to Build a Global Brand Without a Global Budget\nPhil Nottingham,&nbsp;Brand and Video Marketing Strategist, Phil Nottingham Ltd.\nAs funnel-based marketing becomes less effective and harder to measure, \"building a brand\" is frequently touted as the panacea for all marketer's woes. But it's unclear how this can be achieved scalably and with a limited budget. Large enterprises resort to huge creative advertising campaigns that get their names out there by force of spend alone — but this isn't realistic for the smaller companies and the number of impressions is not the number of people impressed. In this session, Phil explains how modern brands are built through advocacy more than awareness alone, offering a deliverable method of brand marketing to radically shake up your content strategy.\n11:15am – Stream 2&nbsp;–&nbsp;The Science of Seeking Your Customer\nAlexis Sanders,&nbsp;Senior SEO Account Manager, Merkle\nUsers are at the core of everything we do in modern SEO.

Alexis will cover how to find your audience, share tools that are available for all price points, and show ways in which she’s found audience research to be useful as an SEO.\n12:10pm – Birds of a Feather discussion groups\nConnect and chat with like-minded marketers on a wide range of digital marketing&nbsp;topics!\n12:55pm –&nbsp;Keynote –&nbsp;Moving Targets: Keywords in Crisis\nDr.&nbsp;Peter J. Meyers,&nbsp;Marketing Scientist, Moz\nToo often, we take a once-and-done approach to keyword research, but Google changes at the pace of information, and that pace speeds up even more during a crisis. How do we do keyword research in fast-paced industries and during world-changing moments? Dr. Pete provides concrete tactics for adaptive keyword research and spotting trends as they happen.\n1:45pm – Stream 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;A Novel Approach to Scraping SEO Data\nRob Ousbey, VP Product, Moz\nThroughout a decade in SEO consulting, Rob needed to extract data from websites on many an occasion. Often this was at scale from sites that didn't have an API or export feature, or on sites that required some kind of authentication. While this was primarily a way to collect & combine data from different SEO tools, the use-cases were endless.\nHe found a technique that helped immensely, particularly when traditional tools couldn't do the job — but hadn't seen anyone using the same approach. In this very tactical session, Rob will walk through the steps he's used to extract data from all sorts of sites, from small fry to the giants, and give you the tools and knowledge to do the same.\n1:45pm – Stream 2&nbsp;– Let It Go: How to Embrace Automation and Get Way More Done\nFrancine Rodriguez,&nbsp;Manager of Customer Success,&nbsp;WordStream\nLet the robot uprising begin! We've all heard horror stories about the dangers of automating your tasks, but now is not the time to deny yourself extra help. Robots never sleep. They don't get tired or overwhelmed by their to-do lists, and they're ready to work round-the-clock to accomplish whatever task we set before them. In this talk, you'll explore all the areas were automation is kicking butt in PPC — and how you can harness the power of robots to make more time for other efforts.\n2:35pm – Keynote –&nbsp;Designing a Content Engine: Going from Ideation to Creation to Distribution\nRoss Simmonds,&nbsp;CEO, Foundation\nWhat does it take to develop a content engine that drives results? In this presentation, Ross will share data around the power of having a content engine, tools & strategies for content ideation, tools and tactics for content creation, and frameworks that brands can use to ensure that their content is distributed effectively after hitting publish. This presentation will help you not only uncover content-market fit, but also capitalize on it.\n3:30pm – Networking\nOpen time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.\n4:30pm — Day One is in the books!\n\nWednesday, July 15th\n\n8:30am – Networking\nOpen time for attendees to connect with other attendees and MozCon partners.\n9:00am – Welcome to Day Two!\nCyrus Shepard, emcee\n9:10am – Keynote – Accessible Machine Learning Workflows for SEOs\nBritney Muller,&nbsp;Senior SEO Scientist, Moz\n\"Machine learning\" and \"automation\" aren't words SEOs need to fear. Machine learning enthusiast and ambassador of technical SEO Britney Muller shares a series of workflows intended for any SEO to access and use in their everyday work — no intimidation required.\n9:55am – Stream 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;How to Be Ahead of the (CTR) Curve\nIzzi Smith,&nbsp;Technical SEO Analyst, Ryte\nLet’s face it: Carrying out SEO magic is all in vain when you’re forgetting about how your brand and products are being surfaced in the SERPs. By not properly analyzing or enhancing our organic CTR, we're greatly limiting our potential. Izzi will help you create the perfect SERP engagement strategy by covering practical ways to uplift your significant CTR, such as remedying your critical keyword rankings that could soon be lost, leveraging brand-empowering entity features (and assessing the risks of doing so), more intelligent testing of rich & featured snippet optimizations, and a whole lot more. CTR-you-ready?? You better be!\n9:55am – Stream 2&nbsp;–&nbsp;How to Go Beyond Marketing for Clients: The Value of a Thriving Brand Ecosystem\nFlavilla Fongang,&nbsp;Brand Strategist, 3 Colours Rule\nToo many marketers serve their clients the bare minimum of what's expected from an agency. To stand out among the crowd, cultivate real loyalty, and maximize the lifetime value of your clients, you have to go beyond mere marketing — developing a thriving brand ecosystem that aligns with the brand's ultimate goals. Flavilla Fongang shares her tried-and-true framework for optimizing the customer journey, improving acquisition and retention, and going beyond what's expected to serve your clients well.\n10:50am&nbsp;– Stream 1&nbsp;– How to Promote Your Content Like a Boss\nBrian Dean,&nbsp;Founder, Backlinko\nCreating content is easy. But getting people to see your content? That's a different story. Brian Dean shares over a dozen practical strategies that you can use to spread the word about your latest blog post, podcast episode, or YouTube video.\n10:50am – Stream 2&nbsp;– Google My Business: Battling Bad Info & Safeguarding Your Search Strategy\nJoy Hawkins,&nbsp;Owner, Sterling Sky Inc.\nWhat's the harm in a little misinformation here and there? In the realm of local SEO, Joy Hawkins is here to outline exactly that. When it comes to local search and Google My Business, bad info can be make or break for your campaigns. Follow real data from a recent case study that illustrates why strategic decisions should be based on accurate information — and what can happen when that info is bad, wrong, or just plain incomplete.\n11:45am – Birds of a Feather discussion groups\nConnect and chat with like-minded marketers on a wide range of digital marketing topics!\n12:10pm –&nbsp;Keynote&nbsp;– Runtime: The 3-Ring Circus of Technical SEO\nMichael King,&nbsp;Managing Director, iPullRank\nMike redefined technical SEO and its importance in our industry back in 2016.

This year, he's back to share the hottest technical tactics to up-level your efforts, plus the case studies and data that should be guiding your decisions.\n1:25pm –&nbsp;Stream 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;Everyday Automation for Marketers\nDavid Sottimano,&nbsp;Independent Marketing Consultant, Opensource.org\nAs a general rule, we shouldn't be doing things that a computer can do better.

Or how about when you start that new job, except you can’t seem to make any forward progress because you’re always mopping up prior mistakes? Running a discovery process at the start of a project — or even as its own project — will help you turn those red flags into green lights.\n2:20pm – Stream 1&nbsp;– Competitive Advantage in a Commoditized Industry\nHeather Physioc,&nbsp;Group Connections Director, Discoverability, VMLY&R\nSEO isn't dead — it’s commoditized. In a world where search companies are a dime a dozen and brands tout bland \"unique selling propositions\" that aren't unique at all, how can you avoid drowning in the sea of sameness?

I’m dedicating today’s column to the manager of a nearby Sprouts grocery store who personally drove my order to my door when an Instacart driver just couldn’t get the job done.</p>\n<p>If your business or clients are weighing whether to fulfill delivery in-house or partner with a third party, my small experience is an apt footnote to the huge, emergent debate over last-mile fulfillment options. I’d searched all over town for scarce potatoes, finally arranging by phone with the local Sprouts market to hold their last two bags for me one morning, and texting the Instacart driver about where the spuds were being held. Next:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf0c6d905.56291685.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"397\" data-image=\"y9ol5ifzxpkx\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>For whatever reason, the driver chose not to retrieve them, claiming the manager told them there was nothing being held for me. Not knowing whom to believe, I phoned the manager who confirmed the driver had never asked for the potatoes and, to my astonishment, told me he was going to bring the groceries to my house right away, himself. </p>\n<p>“I feel really bad about this,” he said. “Sometimes Instacart’s drivers just go so fast, they don’t do a good job. It’s really important to me that my customers get good service and feel good about our store, especially with this hard time we’re all going through.”</p>\n<p>And that’s the crux of what has suddenly become a pressing issue for millions of local businesses, as well as all local search marketers who draw a through-line between reputation and revenue. </p>\n<p>Today, we’ll:</p>\n<ul><li>Stack up the pros and cons of in-house vs. third-party delivery</li><li>Interview a software engineer who has been on the ground with this evolving narrative of critical choices</li><li>Excerpt the revealing comments of a former head of development at Grubhub. </li><li>Plan SEO and marketing strategy for competing with corporate delivery</li><li>Examine the welfare of and best options for drivers</li><li>Help your brand or clients make a better-informed delivery decision</li></ul>\n<h2>A piece of the pie</h2>\n<p>On March 15, 2020, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/coronavirus-pandemic-food-delivery-businesses\">downloads of Instacart’s app shot up 218%</a> over their normal daily average. Restaurants, grocers, and a wide variety of retailers have spent the past two months forging paths from shelves to customers’ front doors to meet demand. While initial implementation may have been a scramble for the state of emergency, we’re getting to the place where it’s time to talk long-term plans.</p>\n<p>I recently surveyed a group of several hundred local business owners and local search marketers to ask whether they intend to permanently offer home delivery. Of those who answered “yes,” I asked whether they would be staffing up an in-house delivery fleet or outsourcing to a third party, like Instacart, or Postmates, GrubHub, or Uber Eats. I found it amazing that my survey group was split right down the middle:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/deliverypiechart1-21242.jpg\" data-image=\"4oapxhyceca4\"></figure>\n<p>Clearly, there’s an even divide between brands that expect to manage the entire customer experience from start to finish, and those whose circumstances are causing them to entrust the last mile to a workforce they can’t directly control. I wondered if the 50/50 split represented settled decisions or indecisions and, also, how my pie chart might look a year from today, when all parties have had more time for implementation and analysis.</p>\n<p>For now, we’ll start by examining another type of pie with a technician who experienced a pizza company shifting from in-house to third-party delivery.</p>\n<h2>A tale of cold pizza and ghosting drivers</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf20db103.77064926.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\" data-image=\"ccyyyb8czwjw\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>My friend is a software engineer who worked on last-mile delivery integration for a headlining US pizza startup, and whose anonymized takeaways serve as a stunning cautionary tale. The engineer tells it this way:</p>\n<p>“We started with an in-house delivery fleet, with two drivers assigned to each company vehicle and each vehicle servicing a radius of approximately five miles. Delivery times were under fifteen minutes with this setup, and we had a ton of very happy customers. Leadership then decided to outsource delivery to a well-known third party.”</p>\n<p>Take note of what happened next.</p>\n<p>“Average delivery time shot up to sixty minutes for peak dinner hours, and holidays were especially bad. One Hallowe’en, it was taking three hours for customers to receive their dinnertime pizza because of driver availability. The third party can’t simply add more drivers as they have no control over when drivers sign onto their platform, but with an in-house fleet, you can plan for high demand and increase staffing. And, instead of having an in-house driver waiting with their truck on the premises to take a delivery, you have to wait for the third party to assign a driver (between 5-30 minutes), wait for the driver to arrive (another 5-30 minutes), and then, finally, deliver. You’d sometimes see deliveries assigned to third-party drivers twenty miles away who would end up ghosting because they don’t want to be bothered with the long drive.”</p>\n<p>As for technical concerns, the engineer told me:</p>\n<p>“Technically, the third-party service was not reliable. I had to deal with a lot of random bugs in their API, as well as constant service interruption, and they had very poor engineering support for their API. This might not be true of all third-party services, of course.”</p>\n<p>And, finally, here’s how the engineer summed up the impact of this on customers:</p>\n<p>“The third-party delivery fleet wasn’t just inefficient in terms of time, but often, they didn’t have the proper bags to keep the pizzas warm. Customers waiting a long time for cold pizza will obviously lead to dissatisfaction. In-house drivers care more about the product they’re delivering, in my experience. I’m convinced that, given the choice, customers would always prefer restaurants to have in-house delivery staff, but it’s hard to compete nowadays with the big name last-mile platforms. Some brands have taken a very public stance on refusing to work with third parties, and I’d like to see Google and Yelp roll out features to let customers know when businesses have their own delivery staff, because it can make such a difference for the customer.”</p>\n<p>As a local SEO, I know that difference for the customer is going to show up in the reviews and word-of-mouth sentiment for any brand, and that, cumulatively, it could equal the brand building, maintaining, or shedding loyalty. Reputation can, quite literally, be the difference between solvency and closure. </p>\n<h2>Positive press for third-party deliveries</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf29b3010.23476444.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"212\" data-image=\"mg888je1nt8u\"></figure>\n<p></p>\n<p>If there are so many potential negatives associated with outsourcing delivery, why do so many successful brands go this route? We’ve looked at some cons, but this shortlist of pros is illuminating:</p>\n<ul><li>Third parties have their own, highly-visible, well-ranked directories of businesses they service. These websites are hard to compete with if you’re not included in them. Seen in a certain light, third parties can bring a business new visibility and new customers. More on this ahead.</li><li>Third parties have ordering technology, logistics, drivers and either proprietary or driver-owned vehicles all ready to go, doing much of the heavy lifting. Not having to pay for a fleet of vehicles or directly pay the wages of drivers can impact brands’ initial, fixed, and ongoing costs. Concerns about insuring these drivers also belong to the third party, not the brand.</li><li>Third-party reliance means the grocer can focus on groceries and the chef can focus on cooking, not delivery. For some brands, the challenge of becoming delivery experts is just too distracting.</li></ul>\n<p>Many brands report having a good experience with major third parties. It’s important to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.qsrmagazine.com/restaurant-operations/house-versus-third-party-delivery-debate-rages\">read pre-COVID stories like these</a> told by QSR’s Daniel P. Smith about companies that have relied on these providers for multiple years.

In 2017, they turned the last mile over to DoorDash and were so pleased with the operation that they’re now also partnering with Uber Eats and Grubhub. </li><li>Two years ago, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.habitburger.com/\">Habit Burger Grill</a> launched a Postmates partnership in Northern California, and were happy enough with the arrangement to expand delivery from all 240 of their locations via Postmates, Doordash, and Uber Eats. </li><li>Meanwhile, the 40-unit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justsalad.com/\">Just Salad</a> chain has been using Grubhub since it launched sixteen years ago and praises their delivery time of under 35 minutes. At the same time, Just Salad also has an in-house delivery fleet. CEO Nick Kenner states that the company would prefer customers to choose the brand’s own delivery service, to “cut out the middleman.”</li></ul>\n<p>That last point is absolutely key to this story and to the third-party vs. in-house decision.</p>\n<h2>Cost issues with the middleman</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><span id=\"selection-marker-end\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\">﻿</span><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf34e3918.84277831.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" data-image=\"gkptv06ezr93\"></figure>\n<p>A narrative amplifying in volume during the public health emergency is that third-party delivery fees simply aren’t sustainable for small businesses. When BBQ restaurant owner Andy Salyards <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/05/02/bay-area-businesses-say-corporate-delivery-services-are-hurting-business\">shared his Uber Eats bill with a local news station</a>, I started doing some math. </p>\n<ul><li>Salyards made $636.00 (pre-tax) selling 22 dinners.</li><li>Uber Eats charged him $190.80 to deliver them.</li><li>Salyards paid Uber Eats 30% of his earnings.</li></ul>\n<p>I found averages stating that a driver can typically make 2.5 deliveries per hour, though this depends on geography. Out of respect for the drivers, let’s hypothesize that Salyards is operating in a city that’s passed a $15 minimum wage and that he decides to employ in-house delivery persons. </p>\n<ul><li>It would take 8.8 hours for one driver to make 22 deliveries.</li><li>8.8 hours x $15 an hour = 132.00. </li><li>Salyards would be paying 20.75% for in-house delivery instead of 30% for third-party fulfillment for the same work in this dynamic. And obviously, where the minimum wage is lower, Salyards costs for in-house delivery would be far less.</li></ul>\n<p>On the face of it, in-house fleets look far more profitable than third parties, but here’s what my math doesn’t cover:</p>\n<ul><li>Do in-house drivers use their own cars, or does the business have to make a major initial investment in a vehicle fleet? </li><li>Who pays for gas/electric charging, auto maintenance, and liability insurance?</li><li>How do you measure out the benefits of marketing your own brand by advertising on your company vehicles, vs. the loss of that opportunity because third-party vehicles don’t display your logo?</li><li>What is the true cost to reputation, retention, and revenue when a brand loses control of the last mile of the customer experience? Is there an acceptable level of customer dissatisfaction caused by slower delivery times, lack of proper equipment, or ghosting drivers?</li></ul>\n<p>Each business has a unique scenario, and all of them will need to find customized answers to all of these questions. </p>\n<h2>Trust issues with the middleman</h2>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf3f07ba6.18310589.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" data-image=\"nq5dm9zf6zd3\"></figure>\n<p>Customer service rules the viability of local businesses, and the best ones labor over every aspect of their operations to get things just right.

Sadly, I invented a lot of the food delivery technologies that are now being used for evil…COVID-19 is exposing the fact that delivery platforms are not actually in the business of delivery. They are in the business of finance... like payday lenders for restaurants and drivers…</p>\n<p>In the case of restaurants, these platforms slowly siphon off your customers and then charge you to have access to them. They are simultaneously selling these same customers to your competitor across the street, but, don’t worry, they are also selling their customers to you.</p>\n<p>For drivers, they are banking on a workforce that is willing to mortgage their assets, like cars and time, well below market value, in exchange for money now. They know that most delivery drivers are simply not doing the math...If they did, drivers would realize that they are actually the ones subsidizing the cost of delivery.</p>\n<p>Delivery platforms are “hyper-growth” businesses that are trying to grow into a no-growth industry. Food consumption really only grows at the rate of population growth, so if you want to grow faster than that, you have to take market share from someone else. Ideally, you take it from someone weaker, who has less information. In this industry, the delivery platforms have found unsuspecting victims in restaurants and drivers… Restaurants need to realize that they are now running e-commerce businesses and they need to act accordingly. Being proficient on Google, Yelp, Facebook and the dozens of other platforms is no longer optional, it is essential.”</p>\n<p>Local SEOs will nod their heads over the need for local Internet proficiency, but it’s Wallace’s summation of the welfare of the drivers that strikes the most discordant note with me for relationships hinging on trust. </p>\n<p>The Instacart driver who didn’t bother to bring me my potatoes sincerely worries me, not for my family’s sake, but for theirs. I already knew before reading Collin Wallace’s comments that some gig workers are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/07/the-uber-drivers-forced-to-sleep-in-parking-lots-to-make-a-decent-living\">living in their cars</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/when-their-shifts-end-uber-drivers-set-up-camp-in-parking-lots-across-the-u-s\">camping in parking lots</a>, and being forced to choose between <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/25/uber-lyft-gig-economy-coronavirus\">safety and money</a>.

One of my own nieces is a gig worker, and she’s out there today as I write this column, trying to make ends meet and sanitizing her hands every five minutes. I’m worried about her every single day.</p>\n<p>There are local business owners who treat their staff like family, and others who don’t. Where trust and your brand’s reputation are involved, a question that deserves to be asked is whether you can trust business partners and models that rely on a desperate workforce. How do you feel about your handcrafted pizza being delivered, not by employees whose wellbeing you directly influence, but by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/30/746600105/1-in-4-food-delivery-drivers-admit-to-eating-your-food\">one in four drivers who are hungry enough to be eating the food they’re supposed to deliver</a>? </p>\n<p>As we look ahead with hope to a post-COVID marketplace, it’s worth taking the time to reflect on this question and how it relates to the quality of life in the community where you live and serve. </p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Dignified work for local delivery drivers</h2>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><span id=\"selection-marker-start\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\">﻿</span><span id=\"selection-marker-end\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\">﻿</span><img src=\"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/deliverydriverwellbeing-88523.jpg\" data-image=\"4icp0340v9hm\"></figure>\n<p><br>“Please leave it on the walkway.

Take care!”</p>\n<p>This is the socially-distant duet I now sing through my kitchen window several times a week with the essential delivery workforce. While we may not deserve a Grammy, I do feel every driver who has brought water, food, and goods to my family these past few months deserves more than recognition — they deserve a dignified workplace and wage. </p>\n<p>If Grubhub’s former head of innovation is troubled by drivers subsidizing delivery costs in exchange for urgently-needed quick money, I am completely convinced that no local community is improved by reliance on an underpaid workforce with few protections, inadequate healthcare in time of illness, or housing insecurity. That’s the thing about seeing life through a local SEO’s lens: everyone is a neighbor, and people working in your city are your friends and family. </p>\n<p>I would prefer my niece to find work with a local business with an in-house delivery fleet being paid a living wage. I’d prefer her workforce to have a union, too.

You and your work are essential, and if you plan to work in delivery for the long haul, finding a union job, like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.apwu.org/\">American Postal Workers Union</a>, is likely to offer you the most protections and benefits.</p>\n<p>It’s not accurate to state that in-house drivers will automatically do a better job than gig workers for third parties. Many gig workers are going above and beyond to provide excellent service, day-in-day-out. But it’s only the in-house model that enables employers to ensure staff are receiving what they need to support themselves and support the brand.

Think of me, and my hunt for taters, and my feelings of uncertainty about trusting Instacart again, or any business that’s using them for fulfillment right now. </p>\n<h2>If you opt for in-house delivery, how will you compete?</h2>\n<p>While competition will differ from market to market, here’s a very simple schematic of the typical set of Google results I’ve seen in my region for delivery-related queries, broken down into third-party vs. in-house delivery entries:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf5d87099.63585684.jpg\" width=\"372\" height=\"704\" data-image=\"7bhni07th41l\"></figure>\n<p>As referenced above, corporate delivery services have massive, authoritative websites and big ad budgets that allow them to gobble up visibility in Google’s SERPs (search engine results pages). In my schematic of 16 opportunities — which represents an actual SERP in my town for the keyword phrase “hamburger delivery near me” —  10 of the entries are being bought or won by brands like GrubHub, DoorDash, and Postmates.</p>\n<p>If your business isn’t listed on the highly-ranked directories published by these services, and you lack a large paid advertising budget, a SERP like this leaves you just six places to compete for the customer’s attention. Here’s a basic three-part framework for how to compete:</p>\n<h3>1. Build your business for customers </h3>\n<p>If Collin Wallace is right in casting third parties as payday lenders and in the business of finance, your competitive advantage is to be in the business of customers’ needs. In practical terms, this means:</p>\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/mapping-local-essentials\">Analyzing what’s essential</a> to the community you wish to serve.</li><li>Investing in staffed, always-on lines of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/local-customer-service-ecosystem-2019\">communication with customers</a> and vigorously inviting feedback.</li><li>On-going analysis of all forms of customer sentiment, especially <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/diagramming-the-story-of-a-1-star-review\">online reviews</a>, as cues for operational improvements.</li><li>Mastering <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/customer-edit-negative-review\">transforming negative sentiment into positive sentiment</a>.</li><li>Determining to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/2020-local-seo-success\">feed, fight, and flip Google</a> in ways that will benefit your local community.</li></ul>\n<h3>2. Build the strongest website you can</h3>\n<p>The usefulness, optimization, and technical quality of your website will all help you compete in both the organic and local SERPs. The more competitive your market, the more you will need to invest in implementing:</p>\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/on-site-seo\">Organic on-site SEO</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/building-local-business-website\">On-site local SEO</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/keyword-research\">Keyword research</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/local-content-building-geo-topical-authority\">Local content publication</a> and marketing, including great content about your delivery service</li><li>E-commerce and delivery technology</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/linked-unstructured-citations\">Local link building</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/find-local-competitors\">Local competitive analysis</a> (check out the beta of Moz’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/local-market-analytics-announcement\">Local Market Analytics</a> for pro-level analysis)</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/technical-seo\">Technical SEO</a></li></ul>\n<p>Moz’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo\">Beginner’s Guide to SEO</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/local\">Local Learning Center</a> will get you well on your way to competitive wins. And double down in writing about the superlatives of your delivery service — don’t be shy about explaining exactly why ordering directly from your brand is best for the customer, the business, the delivery staff, and the community. </p>\n<h3>3. Build the strongest local SERP presence you can</h3>\n<p>Your ability to publish, distribute, and manage your non-website-based local assets will strongly contribute to your ability to compete in Google’s local search engine results. Depending on your market competition, you’ll need to meet and exceed your competitors’ investments in:</p>\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/ultimate-cheat-sheet-google-knowledge-panels\">Managing all aspects of your Google Business Profiles</a>, from basic informational fields, to reviews, to Google Posts, menus, Q&A, photos, and more.</li><li>Getting your other third-party local business listings in good shape with complete and accurate data (a service like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/products/local\">Moz Local</a> can help with this). </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://moz.com/blog/simple-spam-fighting\">Fighting Google local spam</a> with determination.</li><li>Staying alert: if a third-party delivery service “mysteriously” appears on your Google listing, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9503613\">take these steps to request removal</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>There’s no downplaying the hold corporate delivery websites have on Google’s SERPs, nor the fact that Google has special relationships with some of them that redound to Google’s own financial interests. In competitive markets, it will be no easy task to compete with these brands. Many local businesses may feel that “if you can’t beat them, join them” is the only option to remain operational. </p>\n<p>But don’t overlook the powers you do have to compete by dint of running a beloved business and a brilliant search marketing strategy. You could even choose to utilize a third-party service only until you’ve got a large, built-in customer base you can guide to come directly to you for fulfillment in the years ahead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Summing up third-party vs. in-house delivery risks and benefits</h2>\n<p>As you evaluate which solution will be the best fit for last-mile operations for your brand, you’ll want to painstakingly chart out the pros and cons of each option. Here’s my simple checklist to get you started, delineating which solution is most likely to afford the benefits we’ve covered today, as well as a few extra points of consideration:</p>\n<figure class=\"full-width\"><img src=\"http://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/third-party-vs-in-house-delivery-guide/5eeabaf69081c1.63668756.jpg\" width=\"624\" height=\"629\" data-image=\"vioov0ev4zx7\"></figure>\n<p>It’s too soon to predict what the sum total of change will be to the whole concept of delivery across all relevant industries. I talked with multiple business owners on St. Patrick’s Day, when California instituted its shelter-in-place order and all of them were hustling to create piecemeal solutions for remaining operational and serving my community. Several months later, brands are in a better position to evaluate consumer feedback and make adjustments to their delivery strategy. </p>\n<p>As our risk/benefit chart shows, there are clear pros and cons for in-house vs. third-party implementation. Many brands will take a “best of both worlds” approach, like Just Salads, while hoping more customers come directly to them instead of their outsourcing partner. Other business owners may steer clear of the big delivery brands and bet on a smaller service, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.takeoutcentral.com/\">Takeout Central </a>serving North Carolina, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lodel.com/\">Lodel</a> covering seven states in the American West.&nbsp;And definitely check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.localogy.com/restaurant-cooperative-chomps-back-at-high-delivery-commissions/\">this CHOMP restaurant cooperative story</a> over at Localogy.</p>\n<p>What we can say with certainty in June of 2020 is that the brands you operate and market have major decisions to make about serving customers in both the best and worst of times. This is crucial work, and the only thing more important in local commerce right now is the significant power brands are suddenly wielding to set standards for how delivery and delivery persons will work. Recognize that power.</p>\n<p>We’ve all had enough of experiencing the “worst”, and it’s motivation enough to plan a better future, with consistently excellent service for customers, the building blocks of lucrative reputation for brands, and local communities that deliver fair and dignified livelihoods for valued essential workers. </p><br /><p><a href=\"https://moz.com/moztop10\">Sign up for The Moz Top 10</a>, a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by MiriamEllis﻿﻿\nImage credit: Robert Couse-Baker\nBefore all else, gratitude to every delivery person, whether in-house or third party, doing the essential work of keeping households safer and supplied in these times. I’m dedicating today’s column to the manager of a nearby Sprouts grocery store who personally drove my order to my door when an Instacart driver just couldn’t get the job done.\nIf your business or clients are weighing whether to fulfill delivery in-house or partner with a third party, my small experience is an apt footnote to the huge, emergent debate over last-mile fulfillment options. I’d searched all over town for scarce potatoes, finally arranging by phone with the local Sprouts market to hold their last two bags for me one morning, and texting the Instacart driver about where the spuds were being held. Next:\n\n\nFor whatever reason, the driver chose not to retrieve them, claiming the manager told them there was nothing being held for me. Not knowing whom to believe, I phoned the manager who confirmed the driver had never asked for the potatoes and, to my astonishment, told me he was going to bring the groceries to my house right away, himself. \n“I feel really bad about this,” he said. “Sometimes Instacart’s drivers just go so fast, they don’t do a good job. It’s really important to me that my customers get good service and feel good about our store, especially with this hard time we’re all going through.”\nAnd that’s the crux of what has suddenly become a pressing issue for millions of local businesses, as well as all local search marketers who draw a through-line between reputation and revenue. \nToday, we’ll:\nStack up the pros and cons of in-house vs. third-party deliveryInterview a software engineer who has been on the ground with this evolving narrative of critical choicesExcerpt the revealing comments of a former head of development at Grubhub. Plan SEO and marketing strategy for competing with corporate deliveryExamine the welfare of and best options for driversHelp your brand or clients make a better-informed delivery decision\nA piece of the pie\nOn March 15, 2020, downloads of Instacart’s app shot up 218% over their normal daily average. Restaurants, grocers, and a wide variety of retailers have spent the past two months forging paths from shelves to customers’ front doors to meet demand. While initial implementation may have been a scramble for the state of emergency, we’re getting to the place where it’s time to talk long-term plans.\nI recently surveyed a group of several hundred local business owners and local search marketers to ask whether they intend to permanently offer home delivery. Of those who answered “yes,” I asked whether they would be staffing up an in-house delivery fleet or outsourcing to a third party, like Instacart, or Postmates, GrubHub, or Uber Eats. I found it amazing that my survey group was split right down the middle:\n\nClearly, there’s an even divide between brands that expect to manage the entire customer experience from start to finish, and those whose circumstances are causing them to entrust the last mile to a workforce they can’t directly control. I wondered if the 50/50 split represented settled decisions or indecisions and, also, how my pie chart might look a year from today, when all parties have had more time for implementation and analysis.\nFor now, we’ll start by examining another type of pie with a technician who experienced a pizza company shifting from in-house to third-party delivery.\nA tale of cold pizza and ghosting drivers\n\n\n\nMy friend is a software engineer who worked on last-mile delivery integration for a headlining US pizza startup, and whose anonymized takeaways serve as a stunning cautionary tale. The engineer tells it this way:\n“We started with an in-house delivery fleet, with two drivers assigned to each company vehicle and each vehicle servicing a radius of approximately five miles. Delivery times were under fifteen minutes with this setup, and we had a ton of very happy customers. Leadership then decided to outsource delivery to a well-known third party.”\nTake note of what happened next.\n“Average delivery time shot up to sixty minutes for peak dinner hours, and holidays were especially bad. One Hallowe’en, it was taking three hours for customers to receive their dinnertime pizza because of driver availability. The third party can’t simply add more drivers as they have no control over when drivers sign onto their platform, but with an in-house fleet, you can plan for high demand and increase staffing. And, instead of having an in-house driver waiting with their truck on the premises to take a delivery, you have to wait for the third party to assign a driver (between 5-30 minutes), wait for the driver to arrive (another 5-30 minutes), and then, finally, deliver. You’d sometimes see deliveries assigned to third-party drivers twenty miles away who would end up ghosting because they don’t want to be bothered with the long drive.”\nAs for technical concerns, the engineer told me:\n“Technically, the third-party service was not reliable. I had to deal with a lot of random bugs in their API, as well as constant service interruption, and they had very poor engineering support for their API. This might not be true of all third-party services, of course.”\nAnd, finally, here’s how the engineer summed up the impact of this on customers:\n“The third-party delivery fleet wasn’t just inefficient in terms of time, but often, they didn’t have the proper bags to keep the pizzas warm. Customers waiting a long time for cold pizza will obviously lead to dissatisfaction. In-house drivers care more about the product they’re delivering, in my experience. I’m convinced that, given the choice, customers would always prefer restaurants to have in-house delivery staff, but it’s hard to compete nowadays with the big name last-mile platforms. Some brands have taken a very public stance on refusing to work with third parties, and I’d like to see Google and Yelp roll out features to let customers know when businesses have their own delivery staff, because it can make such a difference for the customer.”\nAs a local SEO, I know that difference for the customer is going to show up in the reviews and word-of-mouth sentiment for any brand, and that, cumulatively, it could equal the brand building, maintaining, or shedding loyalty. Reputation can, quite literally, be the difference between solvency and closure. \nPositive press for third-party deliveries\n\n\n\nIf there are so many potential negatives associated with outsourcing delivery, why do so many successful brands go this route? We’ve looked at some cons, but this shortlist of pros is illuminating:\nThird parties have their own, highly-visible, well-ranked directories of businesses they service. These websites are hard to compete with if you’re not included in them. Seen in a certain light, third parties can bring a business new visibility and new customers. More on this ahead.Third parties have ordering technology, logistics, drivers and either proprietary or driver-owned vehicles all ready to go, doing much of the heavy lifting. Not having to pay for a fleet of vehicles or directly pay the wages of drivers can impact brands’ initial, fixed, and ongoing costs. Concerns about insuring these drivers also belong to the third party, not the brand.Third-party reliance means the grocer can focus on groceries and the chef can focus on cooking, not delivery. For some brands, the challenge of becoming delivery experts is just too distracting.\nMany brands report having a good experience with major third parties. It’s important to read pre-COVID stories like these told by QSR’s Daniel P. Smith about companies that have relied on these providers for multiple years. Consider:\nThe Buona family found that trying to focus on delivery detracted from the core operations of their 27-location Italian restaurant chain. In 2017, they turned the last mile over to DoorDash and were so pleased with the operation that they’re now also partnering with Uber Eats and Grubhub. Two years ago, the Habit Burger Grill launched a Postmates partnership in Northern California, and were happy enough with the arrangement to expand delivery from all 240 of their locations via Postmates, Doordash, and Uber Eats. Meanwhile, the 40-unit Just Salad chain has been using Grubhub since it launched sixteen years ago and praises their delivery time of under 35 minutes. At the same time, Just Salad also has an in-house delivery fleet. CEO Nick Kenner states that the company would prefer customers to choose the brand’s own delivery service, to “cut out the middleman.”\nThat last point is absolutely key to this story and to the third-party vs. in-house decision.\nCost issues with the middleman\n\n﻿\nA narrative amplifying in volume during the public health emergency is that third-party delivery fees simply aren’t sustainable for small businesses. When BBQ restaurant owner Andy Salyards shared his Uber Eats bill with a local news station, I started doing some math. \nSalyards made $636.00 (pre-tax) selling 22 dinners.Uber Eats charged him $190.80 to deliver them.Salyards paid Uber Eats 30% of his earnings.\nI found averages stating that a driver can typically make 2.5 deliveries per hour, though this depends on geography. Out of respect for the drivers, let’s hypothesize that Salyards is operating in a city that’s passed a $15 minimum wage and that he decides to employ in-house delivery persons. \nIt would take 8.8 hours for one driver to make 22 deliveries.8.8 hours x $15 an hour = 132.00. Salyards would be paying 20.75% for in-house delivery instead of 30% for third-party fulfillment for the same work in this dynamic. And obviously, where the minimum wage is lower, Salyards costs for in-house delivery would be far less.\nOn the face of it, in-house fleets look far more profitable than third parties, but here’s what my math doesn’t cover:\nDo in-house drivers use their own cars, or does the business have to make a major initial investment in a vehicle fleet? Who pays for gas/electric charging, auto maintenance, and liability insurance?How do you measure out the benefits of marketing your own brand by advertising on your company vehicles, vs. the loss of that opportunity because third-party vehicles don’t display your logo?What is the true cost to reputation, retention, and revenue when a brand loses control of the last mile of the customer experience? Is there an acceptable level of customer dissatisfaction caused by slower delivery times, lack of proper equipment, or ghosting drivers?\nEach business has a unique scenario, and all of them will need to find customized answers to all of these questions. \nTrust issues with the middleman\n\nCustomer service rules the viability of local businesses, and the best ones labor over every aspect of their operations to get things just right. Handing off the home stretch between the physical locale of the business and the customer’s front door is a phenomenal act of trust, and unfortunately, the local SEO industry has long been documenting the damages of trust misplaced. \nTo be completely honest, being set down amid Google, Yelp, and some of the major delivery brands, local business owners are gazelles amid a pride of lions. Some of the more infamous accusations against the lions over the past few years have included:\nYelp and Grubhub cited for partnering up to replace restaurants’ listed phone numbers with Grubhub numbers. Google giving prime placement to Doordash on local business listings and telling furious business owners it’s on them to request removal of these unauthorized links.Grubhub’s awkward refutation and subsequent cancellation of the appearance of cybersquatting —  i.e. buying up the domain names of its customers. Doordash cited for pickpocketing its drivers’ tipsUber Eats cited for giving no thought to safety inspections and delivering food from unvetted backyard BBQers. Most recently, and perhaps most infamously, Doordash cited for unauthorizedly scraping restaurant website menus and opening the door to bizarre pizza arbitrage.\nThis last example, published by Ranjan Roy, received hundreds of frustrated comments, but it was the epic statement of Collin Wallace that glued me to my screen and deserves excerpting here: \n“I was the former Head of Innovation at Grubhub, so I have seen the truth behind many of these claims first hand. Sadly, I invented a lot of the food delivery technologies that are now being used for evil…COVID-19 is exposing the fact that delivery platforms are not actually in the business of delivery. They are in the business of finance... like payday lenders for restaurants and drivers…\nIn the case of restaurants, these platforms slowly siphon off your customers and then charge you to have access to them. They are simultaneously selling these same customers to your competitor across the street, but, don’t worry, they are also selling their customers to you.\nFor drivers, they are banking on a workforce that is willing to mortgage their assets, like cars and time, well below market value, in exchange for money now. They know that most delivery drivers are simply not doing the math...If they did, drivers would realize that they are actually the ones subsidizing the cost of delivery.\nDelivery platforms are “hyper-growth” businesses that are trying to grow into a no-growth industry. Food consumption really only grows at the rate of population growth, so if you want to grow faster than that, you have to take market share from someone else. Ideally, you take it from someone weaker, who has less information. In this industry, the delivery platforms have found unsuspecting victims in restaurants and drivers… Restaurants need to realize that they are now running e-commerce businesses and they need to act accordingly. Being proficient on Google, Yelp, Facebook and the dozens of other platforms is no longer optional, it is essential.”\nLocal SEOs will nod their heads over the need for local Internet proficiency, but it’s Wallace’s summation of the welfare of the drivers that strikes the most discordant note with me for relationships hinging on trust. \nThe Instacart driver who didn’t bother to bring me my potatoes sincerely worries me, not for my family’s sake, but for theirs. I already knew before reading Collin Wallace’s comments that some gig workers are living in their cars, camping in parking lots, and being forced to choose between safety and money. When you have a moment, brace yourself and read Quora threads in which gig drivers are arguing about how little they make. One of my own nieces is a gig worker, and she’s out there today as I write this column, trying to make ends meet and sanitizing her hands every five minutes. I’m worried about her every single day.\nThere are local business owners who treat their staff like family, and others who don’t. Where trust and your brand’s reputation are involved, a question that deserves to be asked is whether you can trust business partners and models that rely on a desperate workforce. How do you feel about your handcrafted pizza being delivered, not by employees whose wellbeing you directly influence, but by one in four drivers who are hungry enough to be eating the food they’re supposed to deliver? \nAs we look ahead with hope to a post-COVID marketplace, it’s worth taking the time to reflect on this question and how it relates to the quality of life in the community where you live and serve. \n \nDignified work for local delivery drivers\n﻿﻿\n“Please leave it on the walkway. Thank you so much!”\n“Okay. You take care!”\n“Thank you. Stay safe! Take care!”\nThis is the socially-distant duet I now sing through my kitchen window several times a week with the essential delivery workforce. While we may not deserve a Grammy, I do feel every driver who has brought water, food, and goods to my family these past few months deserves more than recognition — they deserve a dignified workplace and wage. \nIf Grubhub’s former head of innovation is troubled by drivers subsidizing delivery costs in exchange for urgently-needed quick money, I am completely convinced that no local community is improved by reliance on an underpaid workforce with few protections, inadequate healthcare in time of illness, or housing insecurity. That’s the thing about seeing life through a local SEO’s lens: everyone is a neighbor, and people working in your city are your friends and family. \nI would prefer my niece to find work with a local business with an in-house delivery fleet being paid a living wage. I’d prefer her workforce to have a union, too. This is the advice I would give both as an aunt and as a local SEO, but if you are a driver trying to evaluate your personal decision about where to work, these links are for you:\nHere’s a short but good article from Fast Company comparing in-house to third-party realities for drivers. Read up on Instacart  gig workers unionizing and Safeway drivers unionizing  Read up on gig workers forming the first delivery app unionsCheck out the PayUp initiative organizing for a $15 minimum wage + tips + transparency for gig workers in Washington. Gig Workers Rising is a similar effort in California.\nIn recent memory, many delivery jobs were filled by teenagers — like my big brother at 16 — with a new driver’s license, a stack of pizzas, and a need for part-time income to purchase disco records and car insurance. Now, it’s mothers, fathers, and grandparents driving those long miles to bring absolute necessities to our doors. \nIf you work in delivery, my best advice to you is to study what Collin Wallace has said, study the market, and seek jobs with the best pay and best protections. You and your work are essential, and if you plan to work in delivery for the long haul, finding a union job, like the American Postal Workers Union, is likely to offer you the most protections and benefits.\nIt’s not accurate to state that in-house drivers will automatically do a better job than gig workers for third parties. Many gig workers are going above and beyond to provide excellent service, day-in-day-out. But it’s only the in-house model that enables employers to ensure staff are receiving what they need to support themselves and support the brand. Last year, I did a very quick Twitter poll asking what it is that employees want most:\n\n\n\nEmployers: keep seeing that through-line between reputation and revenue when weighing the wages and working conditions you feel will make your brand most trusted by customers. Think of me, and my hunt for taters, and my feelings of uncertainty about trusting Instacart again, or any business that’s using them for fulfillment right now. \nIf you opt for in-house delivery, how will you compete?\nWhile competition will differ from market to market, here’s a very simple schematic of the typical set of Google results I’ve seen in my region for delivery-related queries, broken down into third-party vs. in-house delivery entries:\n\nAs referenced above, corporate delivery services have massive, authoritative websites and big ad budgets that allow them to gobble up visibility in Google’s SERPs (search engine results pages). In my schematic of 16 opportunities — which represents an actual SERP in my town for the keyword phrase “hamburger delivery near me” —  10 of the entries are being bought or won by brands like GrubHub, DoorDash, and Postmates.\nIf your business isn’t listed on the highly-ranked directories published by these services, and you lack a large paid advertising budget, a SERP like this leaves you just six places to compete for the customer’s attention. Here’s a basic three-part framework for how to compete:\n1. Build your business for customers \nIf Collin Wallace is right in casting third parties as payday lenders and in the business of finance, your competitive advantage is to be in the business of customers’ needs. In practical terms, this means:\nAnalyzing what’s essential to the community you wish to serve.Investing in staffed, always-on lines of communication with customers and vigorously inviting feedback.On-going analysis of all forms of customer sentiment, especially online reviews, as cues for operational improvements.Mastering transforming negative sentiment into positive sentiment.Determining to feed, fight, and flip Google in ways that will benefit your local community.\n2. Build the strongest website you can\nThe usefulness, optimization, and technical quality of your website will all help you compete in both the organic and local SERPs. The more competitive your market, the more you will need to invest in implementing:\nOrganic on-site SEO On-site local SEOKeyword researchLocal content publication and marketing, including great content about your delivery serviceE-commerce and delivery technologyLocal link building Local competitive analysis (check out the beta of Moz’s Local Market Analytics for pro-level analysis)Technical SEO\nMoz’s Beginner’s Guide to SEO and Local Learning Center will get you well on your way to competitive wins. And double down in writing about the superlatives of your delivery service — don’t be shy about explaining exactly why ordering directly from your brand is best for the customer, the business, the delivery staff, and the community. \n3. Build the strongest local SERP presence you can\nYour ability to publish, distribute, and manage your non-website-based local assets will strongly contribute to your ability to compete in Google’s local search engine results. Depending on your market competition, you’ll need to meet and exceed your competitors’ investments in:\nManaging all aspects of your Google Business Profiles, from basic informational fields, to reviews, to Google Posts, menus, Q&A, photos, and more.Getting your other third-party local business listings in good shape with complete and accurate data (a service like Moz Local can help with this). Fighting Google local spam with determination.Staying alert: if a third-party delivery service “mysteriously” appears on your Google listing, take these steps to request removal.\nThere’s no downplaying the hold corporate delivery websites have on Google’s SERPs, nor the fact that Google has special relationships with some of them that redound to Google’s own financial interests. In competitive markets, it will be no easy task to compete with these brands. Many local businesses may feel that “if you can’t beat them, join them” is the only option to remain operational. \nBut don’t overlook the powers you do have to compete by dint of running a beloved business and a brilliant search marketing strategy. You could even choose to utilize a third-party service only until you’ve got a large, built-in customer base you can guide to come directly to you for fulfillment in the years ahead.\n\nSumming up third-party vs. in-house delivery risks and benefits\nAs you evaluate which solution will be the best fit for last-mile operations for your brand, you’ll want to painstakingly chart out the pros and cons of each option. Here’s my simple checklist to get you started, delineating which solution is most likely to afford the benefits we’ve covered today, as well as a few extra points of consideration:\n\nIt’s too soon to predict what the sum total of change will be to the whole concept of delivery across all relevant industries. I talked with multiple business owners on St. Patrick’s Day, when California instituted its shelter-in-place order and all of them were hustling to create piecemeal solutions for remaining operational and serving my community. Several months later, brands are in a better position to evaluate consumer feedback and make adjustments to their delivery strategy. \nAs our risk/benefit chart shows, there are clear pros and cons for in-house vs. third-party implementation. Many brands will take a “best of both worlds” approach, like Just Salads, while hoping more customers come directly to them instead of their outsourcing partner. Other business owners may steer clear of the big delivery brands and bet on a smaller service, like Takeout Central serving North Carolina, or Lodel covering seven states in the American West.&nbsp;And definitely check out this CHOMP restaurant cooperative story over at Localogy.\nWhat we can say with certainty in June of 2020 is that the brands you operate and market have major decisions to make about serving customers in both the best and worst of times. This is crucial work, and the only thing more important in local commerce right now is the significant power brands are suddenly wielding to set standards for how delivery and delivery persons will work. Recognize that power.\nWe’ve all had enough of experiencing the “worst”, and it’s motivation enough to plan a better future, with consistently excellent service for customers, the building blocks of lucrative reputation for brands, and local communities that deliver fair and dignified livelihoods for valued essential workers.
